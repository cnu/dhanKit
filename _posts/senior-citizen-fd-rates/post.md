|----|--------|--------|----------|---------|
| FD 1 | ₹10 L | 1 year | Year 1 | Reinvest or use |
| FD 2 | ₹10 L | 2 years | Year 2 | Reinvest or use |

| FD 5 | ₹10 L | 5 years | Year 5 | Reinvest or use |

**Benefits:**
- Regular liquidity every year
- Can reinvest at prevailing rates
- Reduces interest rate risk

### Strategy 2: Monthly Income FDs

| Bank Type | Rate | ₹30 L Investment | Monthly Income |
|-----------|------|------------------|----------------|
| PSU Bank | 7.00% | ₹30 L | ₹17,500 |
| Private Bank | 7.50% | ₹30 L | ₹18,750 |
| Small Finance Bank | 8.00% | ₹30 L | ₹20,000 |

Choose non-cumulative option with monthly payout.

### Strategy 3: Split Across Banks

| Principle | Reason |
|-----------|--------|
| Max ₹5 L per bank | DICGC insurance limit |
| Multiple banks | Spread risk |
| Mix of bank types | Optimize returns vs safety |

**Example for ₹30 L:**
| Bank | Amount | Type |
|------|--------|------|
| SBI | ₹5 L | Safety |
| HDFC Bank | ₹5 L | Service quality |
| Kotak | ₹5 L | Good rates |
| AU SFB | ₹5 L | High rates |
| Unity SFB | ₹5 L | Highest rates |
| IDFC First | ₹5 L | Balance |

### Strategy 4: Tax-Efficient Distribution

| Spouse | FD Amount | Interest @ 7% | Tax Implication |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Senior citizen 1 | ₹7.14 L | ₹50,000 | 80TTB covers fully |
| Senior citizen 2 | ₹7.14 L | ₹50,000 | 80TTB covers fully |
| Total | ₹14.28 L | ₹1 L | Zero tax |

Split FDs between spouses to maximize 80TTB benefit.

## Small Finance Banks: Higher Returns, What's the Catch?

### Why SFBs Offer Higher Rates

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Newer banks | Need to attract deposits |
| Higher lending rates | Can afford to pay more |
| Competition | Differentiate from big banks |
| Focus on deposits | Core funding source |

### Are SFBs Safe?

| Safety Factor | Status |
|---------------|--------|
| RBI regulated | Yes, same as other banks |
| DICGC insurance | Yes, ₹5 L covered |
| Capital requirements | Same as scheduled banks |
| Audit requirements | Same standards |

**They are as safe as other scheduled banks** for amounts up to ₹5 L (DICGC limit).

### SFB FD Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Branch network | Limited (use online/app) |
| Service quality | Variable |
| Premature withdrawal | Same rules as others |
| Online access | Usually good |

## How to Open Senior Citizen FD

|----------|---------|
| Age proof (Aadhaar/PAN/Passport) | Verify senior citizen status |
| Address proof | KYC |
| Photographs | Account opening |
| Existing account (if any) | Link for interest credit |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Claiming Senior Citizen Rate

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|

| Rate not updated after turning 60 | Inform bank, get rate revised |

### 2. Missing Form 15H Submission

| Impact | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| TDS deducted unnecessarily | Claim refund in ITR (delayed) |
| Cash flow affected | 10% less interest credited |

**Submit Form 15H at start of every financial year.**

### 3. Putting All Money in One Bank

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Beyond ₹5 L not insured | Split across banks |
| Single point of failure | Diversify |

### 4. Ignoring Small Finance Banks

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| SFBs are risky | Same regulation, same insurance |
| Lower service quality | Improving rapidly |

**Consider SFBs** for portion of your FD portfolio (within ₹5 L per bank).

### 5. Choosing Wrong Payout Option

| Need | Choose |
|------|--------|
| Regular income | Non-cumulative (monthly/quarterly) |
| Wealth building | Cumulative |

## Comparison: Bank FD vs Post Office SCSS

| Factor | Bank Senior FD | Post Office SCSS |
|--------|----------------|------------------|
| Interest rate | 7-8% | 8.2% (Q4 2024) |
| Maximum investment | No limit | ₹30 L |
| Lock-in | Flexible tenure | 5 years |
| Premature withdrawal | Allowed (penalty) | After 1 year (penalty) |
| Tax benefit | 80TTB (₹50K) | 80TTB (₹50K) |
| Safety | DICGC ₹5 L | Government guaranteed |

**SCSS offers higher rate** but has ₹30 L limit and 5-year lock-in.

## Quick Decision Guide

| Priority | Best Option |
|----------|-------------|
| Highest rate | Small Finance Bank |
| Best safety | PSU Bank (within ₹5 L) |
| Good service + rate | Private bank |
| Government backing | Post Office SCSS |
| Flexibility | Bank FD (any type) |

## Conclusion

| Tax optimization | Use 80TTB (₹50K), Form 15H |
