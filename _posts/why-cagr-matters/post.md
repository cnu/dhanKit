Your friend boasts: "My fund gave 45% last year!" Meanwhile, you're feeling down about your "boring" 12% return.

But here's what your friend isn't telling you—their fund lost 35% the year before. When you do the math, your steady 12% actually beat their rollercoaster.

This is why CAGR matters more than yearly returns.

## The Problem with YoY Returns

Year-on-Year (YoY) returns show a single year's performance. They're easy to understand but dangerously misleading.

### The Misleading Math

| Year | Fund A (Volatile) | Fund B (Steady) |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Year 1 | +50% | +12% |
| Year 2 | -30% | +12% |
| Year 3 | +40% | +12% |
| Year 4 | -20% | +12% |
| Year 5 | +35% | +12% |

**Simple average:**
- Fund A: (50 - 30 + 40 - 20 + 35) / 5 = **15% average**
- Fund B: 12% average

Fund A looks better with 15% vs 12%, right? Let's see the actual money.

**₹1 lakh invested:**

| End of Year | Fund A Value | Fund B Value |
|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| Year 1 | ₹1,50,000 | ₹1,12,000 |
| Year 2 | ₹1,05,000 | ₹1,25,440 |
| Year 3 | ₹1,47,000 | ₹1,40,493 |
| Year 4 | ₹1,17,600 | ₹1,57,352 |
| Year 5 | ₹1,58,760 | ₹1,76,234 |

**Fund B's steady 12% actually beats Fund A's volatile 15%!**

**Calculate the real return:** Use our [CAGR Calculator](/cagr-calculator) to find true performance.

## What is CAGR?

CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) is the constant rate that would take your investment from starting value to ending value over the given period.

**Formula:**
```
CAGR = ((Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Years) - 1) × 100
```

**For the example above:**

- Fund A: ((₹1,58,760 / ₹1,00,000)^(1/5) - 1) × 100 = **9.7% CAGR**
- Fund B: ((₹1,76,234 / ₹1,00,000)^(1/5) - 1) × 100 = **12.0% CAGR**

Fund B's CAGR is higher despite looking "boring" in YoY returns.

## Why YoY Returns Mislead

### 1. Volatility Destroys Returns

This is called "volatility drag" or "variance drain."

| Year 1 | Year 2 | Simple Avg | Actual CAGR |
|--------|--------|------------|-------------|
| +20% | +20% | 20% | 20.0% |
| +30% | +10% | 20% | 19.6% |
| +40% | 0% | 20% | 18.3% |
| +50% | -10% | 20% | 16.2% |
| +60% | -20% | 20% | 13.1% |

Same 20% simple average, but more volatility = lower actual returns!

### 2. Loss Requires Bigger Gain to Recover

| Loss | Gain Needed to Recover |
|------|------------------------|
| -10% | +11.1% |
| -20% | +25.0% |
| -30% | +42.9% |
| -40% | +66.7% |
| -50% | +100.0% |

A 50% loss needs 100% gain to break even. This is why volatile funds often underperform over long periods.

### 3. Recency Bias Distorts Perception

| Fund's YoY Returns | Impression | Reality |
|--------------------|------------|---------|
| +5%, +8%, +10%, +45% | "Fund is improving!" | May have gotten lucky |
| +30%, +20%, +15%, +10% | "Fund is declining!" | May be normalizing |

Recent returns dominate our perception, but CAGR cuts through recency bias.

## CAGR vs Other Metrics

### CAGR vs Absolute Return

| Metric | What It Shows | Limitation |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| Absolute Return | Total gain/loss | Ignores time |
| CAGR | Annualized gain/loss | Shows real rate |

**Example:** 100% return sounds great—but is it over 5 years (14.9% CAGR) or 10 years (7.2% CAGR)?

### CAGR vs Rolling Returns

| Metric | What It Shows | Limitation |
|--------|---------------|------------|
| CAGR | Single point-to-point rate | Depends on start/end dates |
| Rolling Returns | CAGR over many periods | More data, shows consistency |

Rolling returns (e.g., all 3-year CAGRs over 10 years) show how consistent a fund has been.

### CAGR vs XIRR

| Metric | Best For | Limitation |
|--------|----------|------------|
| CAGR | Lump sum investments | Can't handle multiple cash flows |
| XIRR | SIP investments | Requires cash flow data |

For SIP, use XIRR. For lump sum, use CAGR.

## How to Use CAGR Correctly

### 1. Compare Same Time Periods

**Wrong:** "Fund A's 5-year CAGR is 15%, Fund B's 3-year CAGR is 18%, so Fund B is better."

**Right:** Compare both over 5 years, or both over 3 years.

### 2. Use Longer Periods

| Period | Reliability |
|--------|-------------|
| 1 year | Low (high variance) |
| 3 years | Medium |
| 5 years | Good |
| 10 years | Excellent |

One-year CAGR is essentially a YoY return—not meaningful.

### 3. Consider Starting Point

CAGR from market peaks will look worse. CAGR from market bottoms will look better.

**Solution:** Use rolling returns or compare across multiple start dates.

### 4. Adjust for Risk

Two funds with 12% CAGR are not equal if one had 30% volatility and other had 15%.

| Fund | CAGR | Volatility | Risk-Adjusted |
|------|------|------------|---------------|
| A | 12% | 30% | Poor |
| B | 12% | 15% | Good |

Look at Sharpe Ratio for risk-adjusted comparison.

## Real-World Examples

### Misleading Mutual Fund Ads

**Ad claim:** "Fund XYZ gave 42% returns!"

**What they're hiding:**
- 42% is trailing 1-year return
- Previous year was -15%
- 5-year CAGR is only 9%

**What to look for:**
- 3-year, 5-year, 10-year CAGR
- Comparison vs benchmark CAGR
- Rolling returns consistency

### Stock Market Headlines

**Headline:** "Market up 20% this year!"

**Reality check:**
- Previous year: -15%
- CAGR over 2 years: Only 1.7%

Always ask: "20% from what base?"

### Insurance ULIP Sales Pitch

**Agent:** "You'll get 15% returns!"

**Reality:**
- Gross returns: Maybe 12-14%
- Charges: 2-3% annually
- Net CAGR: 9-11%
- Comparable mutual fund: 12% CAGR

CAGR after all charges is what matters.

## CAGR Benchmarks

### Asset Class Historical CAGRs (India, 20-year)

| Asset | Approximate CAGR |
|-------|------------------|
| Savings account | 3-4% |
| Fixed deposit | 6-7% |
| Gold | 8-10% |
| PPF | 7-8% |
| Nifty 50 | 11-13% |
| Mid-cap funds | 13-16% |
| Small-cap funds | 14-18% |
| Real estate (varies) | 8-12% |

Use these as reference points when evaluating any investment.

### Mutual Fund Category CAGRs (10-year)

| Category | Average CAGR | Top Performers |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Large Cap | 11-12% | 13-14% |
| Flexi Cap | 12-14% | 15-17% |
| Mid Cap | 14-16% | 18-20% |
| Small Cap | 15-18% | 20-25% |
| ELSS | 12-14% | 15-17% |

If a fund claims 20% CAGR in large-cap, be skeptical—verify the time period.

## Common CAGR Mistakes

### 1. Annualizing Short Periods

**Wrong:** "Fund gained 5% in 3 months = 20% annualized!"

**Right:** Short-term returns can't be reliably extrapolated. Report as absolute return.

### 2. Cherry-Picking Period

Fund houses often highlight their best-performing period. A 3-year CAGR starting March 2020 (COVID bottom) will look exceptional.

### 3. Ignoring Dividends

Some CAGR calculations use price-only returns, ignoring dividends. Always use total return CAGR.

### 4. Not Accounting for Taxes

Pre-tax CAGR of 15% ≠ post-tax CAGR of 15%

| Investment | Pre-Tax CAGR | Tax Impact | Post-Tax CAGR |
|------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| Equity MF | 15% | 12.5% LTCG | ~13% |
| Debt MF | 8% | At slab rate | 5-6% |
| FD | 7% | At slab rate | 4-5% |

## Conclusion

**YoY returns are noise. CAGR is signal.**

| When You See | Think |
|--------------|-------|
| "Fund gave 40% last year!" | What's the 5-year CAGR? |
| "Average return of 15%" | What's the actual CAGR? |
| "Doubled in 5 years" | That's 14.9% CAGR—good, not great |
| "10x in 20 years" | That's 12.2% CAGR—solid equity return |

Train yourself to immediately convert any return claim to CAGR. It cuts through marketing hype and reveals true performance.
