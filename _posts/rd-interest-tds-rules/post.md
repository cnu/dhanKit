## TDS on RD Interest

### TDS Threshold

|----------|---------------|----------|
| Regular individuals | ₹40,000/year | 10% |
| Senior citizens (60+) | ₹50,000/year | 10% |
| Without PAN | ₹40,000/year | 20% |

**TDS applies when total interest from a bank exceeds threshold.**

### How TDS is Calculated for RD
