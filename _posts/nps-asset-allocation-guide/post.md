### Why Equity Matters Long-Term

**₹5,000/month NPS for 30 years:**

| Allocation | Expected Return | Corpus at 60 |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|
| 75% E, 15% C, 10% G | 11% | ₹1.24 Cr |
| 50% E, 30% C, 20% G | 9.5% | ₹97 L |
| 25% E, 35% C, 40% G | 8.5% | ₹81 L |
| 0% E, 40% C, 60% G | 7.5% | ₹67 L |

**Higher equity = ₹43-57 L more corpus** over 30 years.

## Active Choice vs Auto Choice

### Active Choice

You manually select allocation percentages.

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Your control | Full (choose E, C, G %) |
| Maximum equity | 75% |
| Rebalancing | Manual (you decide when) |
| Best for | Financially aware investors |

### Auto Choice (Lifecycle Funds)

System automatically adjusts based on age.

| Option | Equity at 35 | Equity at 45 | Equity at 55 |
|--------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Aggressive (LC75) | 75% | 55% | 15% |
| Moderate (LC50) | 50% | 40% | 10% |
| Conservative (LC25) | 25% | 20% | 5% |

**Auto LC75 allocation by age:**

| Age | Equity | Corporate | Govt Sec |
|-----|--------|-----------|----------|
| 25-35 | 75% | 10% | 15% |
| 40 | 55% | 15% | 30% |
| 50 | 25% | 20% | 55% |
| 55 | 15% | 20% | 65% |

## Active vs Auto: Which to Choose?

### Choose Active Choice If

| Criteria | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| You understand asset allocation | Can make informed decisions |
| Want maximum equity exposure | Active allows 75% throughout |
| Plan to actively rebalance | Will review periodically |
| Have other retirement savings | Can take more risk in NPS |

### Choose Auto Choice If

| Criteria | Reason |
|----------|--------|
| First-time investor | System handles complexity |
| Don't want to manage | Set and forget |
| Prefer automatic rebalancing | Reduces risk as you age |
| Unsure about allocation | Default works well |

### Active vs Auto: Performance Comparison

**Assuming same starting age (30) and retirement (60):**

| Choice | Approach | Expected Corpus (₹5K/month) |
|--------|----------|----------------------------|
| Active 75% E throughout | Aggressive | ₹1.24 Cr |
| Auto LC75 | Reduces E with age | ₹1.05 Cr |
| Auto LC50 | Moderate | ₹95 L |
| Auto LC25 | Conservative | ₹85 L |

**Active with high equity wins** but requires discipline to maintain during crashes.

## Rebalancing Your NPS

### When to Rebalance (Active Choice)

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Every 2-3 years | Review allocation |
| After major life event | Adjust risk tolerance |
| Approaching retirement | Reduce equity |
| Market crash (if brave) | Increase equity |

### How to Rebalance

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Log in to CRA (KFintech/Protean) |
| 2 | Go to allocation change section |
| 3 | Enter new percentages |
| 4 | Confirm with OTP/T-PIN |

**Note:** You can change allocation once per financial year (or as per current rules).

### Rebalancing Strategy

| Scenario | Current | Target | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Young, equity underweight | 50% E | 75% E | Increase E by 25% |
| Mid-career | 75% E | 60% E | Reduce E by 15% |
| Pre-retirement | 60% E | 30% E | Reduce E by 30% |

## Impact of Allocation on Corpus

### 30-Year NPS: ₹10,000/Month Contribution

| Allocation | Expected Return | Final Corpus | Difference |
|------------|-----------------|--------------|------------|
| 75/15/10 | 11% | ₹2.48 Cr | +₹1.14 Cr |
| 60/25/15 | 10% | ₹2.08 Cr | +₹74 L |
| 50/30/20 | 9% | ₹1.74 Cr | +₹40 L |
| 30/35/35 | 8% | ₹1.34 Cr | Baseline |

**Wrong allocation can cost you over ₹1 crore.**

### Why 1% Return Matters

| Extra Return | 30-Year Impact on ₹10K/month |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| +1% | +₹35-40 L |
| +2% | +₹75-85 L |
| +3% | +₹1.1-1.2 Cr |

Small allocation changes = Large corpus differences.

## Common Allocation Mistakes

### 1. Too Conservative Too Early

| Age | Wrong Allocation | Right Allocation |
|-----|------------------|------------------|
| 30 | 30% E, 30% C, 40% G | 75% E, 15% C, 10% G |
| Cost over 30 years | ~₹50 L less corpus | Maximum growth |

**At 30, you have 30 years to recover from any crash.**

### 2. Not Reducing Equity Near Retirement

| Age | Wrong | Right |
|-----|-------|-------|
| 55 | 75% E (from age 30) | 25% E |
| Risk | Major crash = delayed retirement | Protected corpus |

**Reduce equity progressively from age 45.**

### 3. Ignoring Corporate Bonds

| Allocation | Issue |
|------------|-------|
| 75% E, 0% C, 25% G | Missing C's balanced returns |
| Better | 75% E, 15% C, 10% G |

Corporate bonds provide better returns than G with moderate risk.

### 4. Switching Allocation During Market Crash

| Action | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Panic switch to 0% E during crash | Locks in losses, misses recovery |
| Better | Maintain or increase E |

**Stay disciplined** with your long-term allocation strategy.

## Allocation Based on Risk Tolerance

### Risk Assessment

| If You Would... | Risk Tolerance | Equity Allocation |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Panic if portfolio drops 30% | Low | 25-40% |
| Feel uncomfortable but hold | Medium | 50-60% |
| See it as buying opportunity | High | 70-75% |

### Sample Allocations by Risk Profile

| Profile | E | C | G | Best For |
|---------|---|---|---|----------|
| Very Aggressive | 75% | 15% | 10% | Young, high risk tolerance |
| Aggressive | 65% | 20% | 15% | Young, moderate risk |
| Balanced | 50% | 30% | 20% | Middle-aged, balanced |
| Conservative | 35% | 35% | 30% | Pre-retirement |
| Very Conservative | 20% | 40% | 40% | Near retirement |

## Fund Manager Performance

### NPS Fund Manager Returns (Equity - Tier I)

| Fund Manager | 1Y Return | 5Y Return | 10Y Return |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| SBI Pension | 18% | 12% | 11% |
| LIC Pension | 17% | 11% | 10% |
| HDFC Pension | 19% | 13% | 11% |
| ICICI Pru Pension | 18% | 12% | 11% |
| Kotak Pension | 17% | 12% | 10% |
| Birla Sun Life | 18% | 12% | - |
| UTI Retirement | 16% | 11% | 10% |

*Returns are indicative. Check PFRDA for latest.*

**Differences are small** (1-2%). Focus more on allocation than fund manager.

## My Recommended Approach

### Age-Based Active Choice Strategy

| Age | E | C | G | Rationale |
|-----|---|---|---|-----------|
| 25-35 | 75% | 15% | 10% | Maximum growth potential |
| 36-40 | 70% | 18% | 12% | Slight moderation |
| 41-45 | 60% | 25% | 15% | Building stability |
| 46-50 | 50% | 30% | 20% | Balanced approach |
| 51-55 | 35% | 35% | 30% | Protecting gains |
| 56-60 | 20% | 35% | 45% | Capital preservation |

### For Those Who Want Simplicity

**Just choose Auto LC75** (Aggressive Lifecycle Fund) and forget about it. The system will automatically reduce equity as you age.

## Conclusion

| Decision | Recommendation |
|----------|----------------|
| Young (< 35) | 75% equity (Active or Auto LC75) |
| Middle (35-50) | 50-70% equity, reduce gradually |
| Pre-retirement (50-60) | 20-40% equity, capital preservation |
| Choice type | Active if engaged, Auto if hands-off |
| Rebalancing | Every 2-3 years or at life events |

**Key takeaways:**
1. Equity is the growth engine—use maximum when young
2. Reduce equity progressively after 45
3. Don't panic during market crashes
4. Small return differences = Large corpus differences
5. Active Choice gives control, Auto Choice gives convenience
