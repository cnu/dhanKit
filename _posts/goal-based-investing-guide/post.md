Investing without goals is like traveling without a destination. You might move, but you won't know if you're getting anywhere.

Goal-based investing transforms vague "I should save more" into specific "I need ₹25 L for down payment in 5 years, so I'll invest ₹34,000/month."

## The Goal-Based Framework

### Step 1: Define Your Goals

| Goal Type | Example | Timeline |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Essential | Emergency fund, insurance | Immediate |
| Short-term | Vacation, gadget | 1-3 years |
| Medium-term | Car, house down payment | 3-7 years |
| Long-term | Child education, retirement | 7+ years |

### Step 2: Calculate Future Cost

| Today's Cost | Years | Inflation | Future Cost |
|--------------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| ₹10 L | 5 | 6% | ₹13.4 L |
| ₹20 L | 10 | 6% | ₹35.8 L |
| ₹50 L | 15 | 8% | ₹1.59 Cr |
| ₹1 Cr | 20 | 6% | ₹3.21 Cr |

### Step 3: Match Investment to Timeline

| Timeline | Risk Level | Investment Type | Calculator |
|----------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| < 2 years | Very Low | FD, Liquid fund | [FD Calculator](/fd-calculator) |
| 2-4 years | Low | Debt fund, RD | [RD Calculator](/rd-calculator) |
| 4-7 years | Moderate | Balanced fund | [SIP Calculator](/sip-calculator) |
| 7+ years | High | Equity fund | [SIP Calculator](/sip-calculator) |

## Goal: Emergency Fund

### Target

| Monthly Expenses | 6-Month Fund | 12-Month Fund (recommended) |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| ₹30,000 | ₹1.8 L | ₹3.6 L |
| ₹50,000 | ₹3 L | ₹6 L |
| ₹80,000 | ₹4.8 L | ₹9.6 L |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹6 L | ₹12 L |

### Investment Strategy

| Vehicle | Allocation | Why |
|---------|------------|-----|
| Liquid fund | 70% | Quick access (T+1) |
| Savings account | 30% | Instant access |

**Do not invest in:** FD (breaks on emergency), equity (volatile).

## Goal: Vacation (1-2 Years)

### Example: ₹2 L Europe Trip in 18 Months

| Strategy | Investment | Monthly |
|----------|------------|---------|
| [RD](/rd-calculator) | Bank RD at 6.5% | ₹10,800 |
| Liquid fund | Liquid fund at 6% | ₹10,900 |
| Ultra-short fund | Ultra-short at 7% | ₹10,700 |

**Recommended:** RD for discipline + guaranteed return.

**Use [RD Calculator](/rd-calculator)** to plan.

## Goal: Car (2-3 Years)

### Example: ₹8 L Car in 3 Years

| Strategy | Investment | Monthly/Lumpsum |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Conservative | RD at 6.5% | ₹20,300/month |
| Moderate | Short-term debt fund (7%) | ₹19,600/month |
| Balanced | Hybrid fund (9%) | ₹18,500/month |

**Recommended:** Mix of debt fund + some balanced fund.

### Should You Take a Car Loan Instead?

| Option | Monthly Outflow | Total Cost |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| Save then buy | ₹18,500 × 36 months | ₹6.66 L (your savings) |
| Loan now | ₹17,200 EMI × 48 months | ₹8.26 L (includes ₹1.6 L interest) |

**Saving first is cheaper** unless car is essential.

**Use [EMI Calculator](/emi-calculator)** to compare.

## Goal: House Down Payment (5-7 Years)

### Example: ₹30 L Down Payment in 6 Years

| Strategy | Expected Return | Monthly SIP |
|----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Conservative (debt) | 7% | ₹34,200 |
| Moderate (balanced) | 9% | ₹31,500 |
| Aggressive (equity) | 12% | ₹27,600 |

**Recommended:** 60% balanced fund + 40% debt fund.

**Use [SIP Calculator](/sip-calculator)** to model scenarios.

### Strategy: Phased De-risking

| Years to Goal | Equity | Balanced | Debt |
|---------------|--------|----------|------|
| 6-5 | 60% | 40% | 0% |
| 4-3 | 30% | 50% | 20% |
| 2-1 | 0% | 30% | 70% |
| < 1 | 0% | 0% | 100% |

Move to safety as goal approaches.

## Goal: Marriage (5-10 Years)

### Example: ₹25 L Wedding in 7 Years

| Strategy | Return | Monthly SIP |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Aggressive (equity) | 12% | ₹19,300 |
| Moderate (balanced) | 10% | ₹21,400 |

**Recommended:** Flexi-cap fund SIP for 7 years.

**Also consider:** Gold savings for jewelry (10-15% of goal).

## Goal: Child's Education (15-18 Years)

### Example: ₹50 L for College in 15 Years

**Important:** Use 8-10% education inflation, not 6%.

| Today's Need | Education Inflation | Future Cost |
|--------------|---------------------|-------------|
| ₹25 L | 8% | ₹79 L |
| ₹50 L | 8% | ₹1.59 Cr |
| ₹1 Cr | 8% | ₹3.17 Cr |

### Investment Strategy for ₹1 Cr Goal

| Return | Monthly SIP | Corpus in 15 Years |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| 12% | ₹20,100 | ₹1.01 Cr |
| 14% | ₹16,600 | ₹1.01 Cr |

**Recommended:**
- 80% equity funds (flexi-cap, mid-cap)
- 20% PPF for safety

**Use [PPF Calculator](/ppf-calculator)** for guaranteed portion.

### De-risking Schedule

| Years to Goal | Equity | Balanced | Debt |
|---------------|--------|----------|------|
| 15-10 | 90% | 10% | 0% |
| 10-5 | 70% | 20% | 10% |
| 5-3 | 40% | 40% | 20% |
| 3-1 | 10% | 30% | 60% |
| < 1 | 0% | 0% | 100% |

## Goal: Child's Marriage (20-25 Years)

### Example: ₹40 L for Wedding in 22 Years

| Return | Monthly SIP | Corpus |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 12% | ₹4,000 | ₹41 L |
| 14% | ₹2,950 | ₹40.5 L |

**Recommended:** Start small, review every 5 years.

**Include gold:** Traditional for Indian weddings.

| Gold Allocation | Monthly | Value in 22 years (8%) |
|-----------------|---------|----------------------|
| 20% of goal | ₹800 | ₹8.5 L |

## Goal: Retirement (20-30 Years)

### Step 1: Estimate Corpus Needed

| Monthly Expense (Today) | Inflation | At Retirement (25 years) | Corpus (4% rule) |
|------------------------|-----------|-------------------------|------------------|
| ₹50,000 | 6% | ₹2.14 L | ₹6.4 Cr |
| ₹75,000 | 6% | ₹3.22 L | ₹9.6 Cr |
| ₹1,00,000 | 6% | ₹4.29 L | ₹12.9 Cr |

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Investment

**Goal: ₹6 Cr in 25 Years**

| Investment | Return | Monthly |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Equity SIP | 12% | ₹38,000 |
| NPS (70% equity) | 10% | ₹46,000 |
| PPF | 7.1% | ₹78,000 |

**Recommended mix:**
- 70% equity SIP
- 20% NPS (for tax benefits)
- 10% PPF (for safety)

**Use [NPS Calculator](/nps-calculator)** for retirement planning.

### Multiple Retirement Income Sources

| Source | Build Through | Expected Income |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| EPF + PPF | Auto + voluntary | ₹50,000/month |
| NPS | 80CCD(1B) contributions | ₹30,000/month |
| Mutual funds | SIP | ₹70,000/month (SWP) |
| Rental (if any) | Property | ₹30,000/month |
| **Total** | | **₹1,80,000/month** |

## Goal: International Education (10-12 Years)

### Example: ₹1.5 Cr for MS Abroad in 12 Years

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Higher cost | Plan for education + living expenses |
| Currency risk | Consider international funds |
| Timing | Start early, invest aggressively |

**Strategy:**
- 80% equity (including 20% international funds)
- 20% balanced funds

| Return | Monthly SIP |
|--------|-------------|
| 12% | ₹51,500 |
| 14% | ₹43,000 |

## Goal Overlap: Multiple Goals

### Example: ₹60K Available Monthly

| Goal | Amount | Timeline | Investment |
|------|--------|----------|------------|
| Emergency fund | ₹10K | 1 year | Liquid fund |
| House down payment | ₹25K | 5 years | Balanced fund |
| Child education | ₹15K | 15 years | Equity fund |
| Retirement | ₹10K | 25 years | Equity + NPS |

**Prioritize:** Emergency → Insurance → Short-term → Long-term
