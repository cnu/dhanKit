Buying a home is likely the biggest financial decision you'll ever make. Taking on a 20-year home loan is a serious commitment—one that can either build wealth or become a financial burden.

The key question isn't "Can the bank approve this loan?" but "Can I comfortably afford this EMI?" Let's figure out your true affordability.

## The 40% Rule: Your EMI Ceiling

Financial experts recommend that your total EMI payments (home loan + car loan + personal loan) should not exceed **40% of your monthly take-home salary**.

For a home loan specifically, keep it under **30-35%** to leave room for other obligations.

| Monthly Take-Home | Max Home Loan EMI (35%) | Max Total EMIs (40%) |
|-------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| ₹50,000 | ₹17,500 | ₹20,000 |
| ₹75,000 | ₹26,250 | ₹30,000 |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹35,000 | ₹40,000 |
| ₹1,50,000 | ₹52,500 | ₹60,000 |
| ₹2,00,000 | ₹70,000 | ₹80,000 |

## From EMI to Loan Amount

Once you know your affordable EMI, you can reverse-calculate the maximum loan amount.

### At 8.5% Interest Rate (20-Year Tenure)

| Affordable EMI | Loan Amount | Property Budget (80% LTV) |
|----------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| ₹17,500 | ₹20.0 L | ₹25.0 L |
| ₹26,250 | ₹30.0 L | ₹37.5 L |
| ₹35,000 | ₹40.0 L | ₹50.0 L |
| ₹52,500 | ₹60.0 L | ₹75.0 L |
| ₹70,000 | ₹80.0 L | ₹1.0 Cr |

**Note:** Banks typically finance 75-80% of property value (LTV - Loan to Value). You'll need 20-25% as down payment.

### Impact of Interest Rate

| Interest Rate | EMI for ₹50 L Loan (20 years) | Total Interest Paid |
|---------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| 8.0% | ₹41,822 | ₹50.37 L |
| 8.5% | ₹43,391 | ₹54.14 L |
| 9.0% | ₹44,986 | ₹57.97 L |
| 9.5% | ₹46,607 | ₹61.86 L |
| 10.0% | ₹48,251 | ₹65.80 L |

A 1% increase in interest rate on a ₹50 L loan costs you ₹7.66 L extra over 20 years.

## Bank Eligibility vs Your Affordability

Banks use different criteria than the 40% rule. They typically look at:

### 1. FOIR (Fixed Obligation to Income Ratio)
Banks allow FOIR of 50-60%, meaning your total EMIs can be up to 50-60% of income. **This is too aggressive**—stick to 40%.

### 2. Multiplier Method
Banks often approve 60x your monthly salary as loan amount.
- Salary: ₹1 L → Bank may approve: ₹60 L loan
- But EMI would be ₹52,000 (52% of salary) — **too high!**

### 3. Age-Based Tenure
| Current Age | Max Tenure | Retirement Age |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| 25-35 | 30 years | 60-65 |
| 36-45 | 25-30 years | 60-65 |
| 46-55 | 15-20 years | 60-65 |
| 55+ | 5-10 years | 60-65 |

**Key insight:** Just because a bank approves a loan doesn't mean you should take it. Banks optimize for maximum interest income, not your financial health.

## The Hidden Costs of Home Loans

Your EMI is just one part of home ownership costs.

### Upfront Costs

| Cost | Typical Amount | For ₹50 L Property |
|------|----------------|-------------------|
| Down payment | 20% of property | ₹10 L |
| Stamp duty | 5-7% of property | ₹2.5-3.5 L |
| Registration | 1% of property | ₹50,000 |
| Legal fees | ₹10,000-25,000 | ₹15,000 |
| Loan processing fee | 0.5-1% of loan | ₹20,000-40,000 |
| **Total upfront** | **~28-30%** | **₹13-14 L** |

### Ongoing Costs

| Cost | Typical Amount | Monthly/Annual |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Society maintenance | ₹3-7/sq.ft | ₹3,000-7,000/month |
| Property tax | 0.1-0.2% of value | ₹5,000-10,000/year |
| Home insurance | 0.05-0.1% of value | ₹2,500-5,000/year |
| Repairs/maintenance | 1% of value | ₹50,000/year |

For a ₹50 L apartment, expect ₹8,000-12,000/month in additional costs beyond EMI.

## Smart Strategies for Home Loan Affordability

### 1. Increase Tenure (Within Reason)

| Loan Amount | 15-Year EMI | 20-Year EMI | 25-Year EMI |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| ₹40 L | ₹39,382 | ₹34,713 | ₹32,018 |
| ₹50 L | ₹49,228 | ₹43,391 | ₹40,022 |
| ₹60 L | ₹59,073 | ₹52,069 | ₹48,027 |

Longer tenure reduces EMI but increases total interest. Sweet spot is usually 15-20 years.

### 2. Joint Loan with Spouse

Adding a co-applicant increases eligibility:
- Combined income considered for FOIR
- Higher loan amount possible
- Both get tax benefits under Section 24 and 80C

**Example:**
- Your salary: ₹80,000/month → Eligible: ₹48 L
- Spouse salary: ₹50,000/month → Combined eligible: ₹78 L

### 3. Consider Home Loan Balance Transfer

If rates drop, transfer your loan:

| Scenario | Current Loan | After Transfer |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| Loan outstanding | ₹40 L | ₹40 L |
| Interest rate | 9.5% | 8.5% |
| Remaining tenure | 15 years | 15 years |
| EMI | ₹41,767 | ₹39,382 |
| **Total savings** | - | **₹4.29 L** |

### 4. Make Part Prepayments

Even small prepayments dramatically reduce tenure:

| Prepayment | Impact on ₹50 L, 20-year loan |
|------------|-------------------------------|
| ₹1 L/year | Tenure reduced by 5 years |
| ₹50,000/year | Tenure reduced by 3 years |
| ₹25,000/year | Tenure reduced by 1.5 years |

**Tip:** Use bonuses and salary hikes for prepayments, not lifestyle inflation.

## Affordability Checklist

Before committing to a home loan, ensure:

- [ ] EMI is under 35% of take-home salary
- [ ] You have 6 months' EMI as emergency fund
- [ ] You've budgeted for maintenance, taxes, and repairs
- [ ] You can handle a 2% interest rate increase
- [ ] You have adequate health and life insurance
- [ ] Your job is stable (avoid buying during probation)

## The Rent vs Buy Decision

Sometimes renting is smarter than buying. Compare:

| Factor | Buy | Rent |
|--------|-----|------|
| Monthly outflow | EMI + Maintenance | Rent |
| Flexibility | Low (locked in) | High (relocate easily) |
| Wealth building | Property appreciation | Invest the difference |
| Risk | Property market, job loss | Rent increases |

**Rule of thumb:** If annual rent is less than 3% of property value, renting may be better financially.

For a ₹1 Cr property:
- EMI + costs: ~₹95,000/month
- If rent: ₹25,000/month
- Invest difference (₹70,000): After 20 years at 12% = ₹7+ Cr

## Income-Wise Property Budget Guide

| Monthly Income | Safe EMI | Loan Amount | Property Budget |
|----------------|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| ₹40,000 | ₹14,000 | ₹16 L | ₹20 L |
| ₹60,000 | ₹21,000 | ₹24 L | ₹30 L |
| ₹80,000 | ₹28,000 | ₹32 L | ₹40 L |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹35,000 | ₹40 L | ₹50 L |
| ₹1,50,000 | ₹52,500 | ₹60 L | ₹75 L |
| ₹2,00,000 | ₹70,000 | ₹80 L | ₹1 Cr |

*Assumes 8.5% interest, 20-year tenure, 80% LTV*

## Conclusion

The right home loan amount isn't the maximum the bank approves—it's the maximum you can comfortably afford while still:
- Saving for retirement
- Handling emergencies
- Enjoying life without constant money stress

Use the 35% EMI rule, factor in all hidden costs, and remember: a slightly smaller home with financial peace beats a big home with constant EMI anxiety.
