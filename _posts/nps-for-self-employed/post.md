## Contribution Strategies for Self-Employed

### Strategy 1: Maximize Tax Benefits

| Contribution | Tax Section | Deduction |
|--------------|-------------|-----------|
| ₹1,50,000 | 80CCD(1) within 80C | ₹1.5 L |
| ₹50,000 | 80CCD(1B) additional | ₹50,000 |
| **Total** | | **₹2,00,000** |

**Contribute ₹2 L annually** to maximize tax benefits.

### Strategy 2: Catch-Up (Starting Late)

| Starting Age | Years to 60 | Monthly Contribution | Corpus at 60 (11%) |
|--------------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 35 | 25 | ₹16,667 | ₹1.73 Cr |
| 40 | 20 | ₹16,667 | ₹1.02 Cr |
| 45 | 15 | ₹16,667 | ₹57 L |

**Start as early as possible.** Every 5-year delay cuts corpus significantly.

### Strategy 3: Income-Based Scaling

| Your Annual Income | Suggested NPS Contribution | Tax Saving (30% bracket) |
|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| < ₹10 L | ₹50,000 (80CCD 1B only) | ₹15,600 |
| ₹10-20 L | ₹1,00,000 | ₹31,200 |
| ₹20 L+ | ₹2,00,000 | ₹62,400 |

### Strategy 4: Irregular Income Handling

For self-employed with variable income:

| Month | Income | NPS Contribution |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| Jan-Mar | Low season | ₹5,000/month |
| Apr-Jun | Medium | ₹10,000/month |
| Jul-Sep | High season | ₹30,000/month |
| Oct-Dec | Medium | ₹10,000/month |
| **Total** | | **₹1,65,000** |

**Adjust contributions based on cash flow.**

## Asset Allocation for Self-Employed

### Recommended Based on Risk Profile

| Profile | Equity (E) | Corporate (C) | Govt (G) |
|---------|------------|---------------|----------|
| Aggressive (< 40 years) | 75% | 15% | 10% |
| Balanced (40-50 years) | 50% | 30% | 20% |
| Conservative (> 50 years) | 25% | 35% | 40% |

### Why Self-Employed Should Consider Higher Equity

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| No employer pension | NPS is primary retirement vehicle |
| No gratuity | Need higher corpus |
| Longer accumulation possible | Can work beyond 60 |
| Higher risk capacity | Business income variability already known |

**Consider 75% equity** if you have 15+ years to retirement.

## Tier I vs Tier II for Self-Employed

### Comparison

| Feature | Tier I | Tier II |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Tax benefit | Yes (80CCD) | No |

| Minimum balance | ₹1,000/year | ₹250 |
| Exit rules | 60% lumpsum, 40% annuity | Full withdrawal |

### How to Use Both
