## Maturity Comparison Example

| Institution | Rate | Invested | Maturity | Interest |
|-------------|------|----------|----------|----------|
| Post Office | 6.7% | ₹6,00,000 | ₹7,18,910 | ₹1,18,910 |

## Conclusion

| Factor | Winner |
|--------|--------|
| Interest rate | Bank (private/SFB) |
| Safety (unlimited) | Post Office |
| Safety (up to ₹5 L) | Tie |
| Flexibility | Bank |
| Convenience | Bank |
| Rural accessibility | Post Office |
| Digital experience | Bank |

**Recommendations:**

| Your Situation | Choose |
|----------------|--------|
| Amount < ₹5 L, want best rate | Private bank or SFB |
| Amount > ₹5 L, safety priority | Post Office |
| Need short tenure (< 5 years) | Bank |
| Rural area, limited options | Post Office |
| Digital savvy, want convenience | Bank |
| Senior citizen | Bank (higher rate) or SCSS |

For most urban investors with deposits under ₹5 L, bank RDs offer better rates and convenience. Post Office RD remains relevant for those prioritizing absolute safety or living in areas with limited bank access.
