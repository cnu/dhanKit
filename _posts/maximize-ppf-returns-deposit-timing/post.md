Did you know that depositing ₹1.5 lakh on April 6th instead of April 5th costs you nearly ₹900 in interest? Over 15 years, poor timing can cost you ₹15,000 or more.

PPF interest calculation has a quirk that smart investors exploit. Here's how to maximize your returns.

## The 5th-of-Month Rule Explained

PPF interest is calculated on the **lowest balance between the 5th and end of each month**.

| Deposit Date | Interest Earned for That Month |
|--------------|--------------------------------|
| 1st to 5th | Full month interest |
| 6th to 31st | Zero interest for that month |

### Why This Matters

**Scenario A:** Deposit ₹1,50,000 on April 5th
- Balance on April 5th: ₹1,50,000
- Interest for April: ₹1,50,000 × (7.1% / 12) = ₹887.50
- You earn 12 months of interest in the year

**Scenario B:** Deposit ₹1,50,000 on April 6th
- Balance on April 5th: ₹0
- Minimum balance (5th to 30th): ₹0
- Interest for April: ₹0
- You earn only 11 months of interest

**Cost of 1-day delay: ₹887.50**

## Lump Sum vs Monthly: The Interest Difference

### Option 1: Lump Sum on April 5th

| Month | Balance | Interest Earned |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| April | ₹1,50,000 | ₹887.50 |
| May | ₹1,50,000 | ₹887.50 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| March | ₹1,50,000 | ₹887.50 |
| **Total** | | **₹10,650** |

### Option 2: Monthly ₹12,500 (Before 5th)

| Month | Deposit | Balance | Interest |
|-------|---------|---------|----------|
| April | ₹12,500 | ₹12,500 | ₹74 |
| May | ₹12,500 | ₹25,000 | ₹148 |
| June | ₹12,500 | ₹37,500 | ₹222 |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| March | ₹12,500 | ₹1,50,000 | ₹887 |
| **Total** | ₹1,50,000 | | **₹5,768** |

### Option 3: Monthly ₹12,500 (After 5th - Say 10th)

| Month | Deposit Date | Interest Earned |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| April | 10th | ₹0 (no balance on 5th) |
| May | 10th | ₹74 (₹12,500 from April) |
| June | 10th | ₹148 (₹25,000 from May) |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | | **₹5,033** |

### Comparison Summary

| Strategy | Annual Interest | vs Best |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| Lump sum on April 5th | ₹10,650 | Baseline |
| Monthly before 5th | ₹5,768 | -₹4,882 |
| Monthly after 5th | ₹5,033 | -₹5,617 |

**Lump sum on April 5th earns almost 2× the interest of monthly deposits.**

## The Optimal PPF Strategy

### If You Have ₹1.5 Lakh Available

**Best:** Deposit entire ₹1,50,000 on April 1-5

| Action | When | Interest Benefit |
|--------|------|------------------|
| Deposit full amount | April 1-5 | Maximum (12 months) |

### If You Invest Monthly

**Best:** Deposit before 5th of each month

| Month | Deposit By | Amount |
|-------|------------|--------|
| April | 5th | ₹12,500 |
| May | 5th | ₹12,500 |
| ... | ... | ... |
| March | 5th | ₹12,500 |

Set a recurring reminder for the 1st-4th of each month.

### If You're Salaried (Paid on 1st)

**Perfect alignment:** Salary comes on 1st, deposit PPF on 1st-5th.

| Event | Date | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Salary credit | 1st | |
| PPF deposit | 1st-5th | ₹12,500 |
| PPF interest calculated | 5th | Earns that month |

### If You're Salaried (Paid on 7th or Later)

**Problem:** Salary comes after the 5th.

**Solution 1:** Deposit from savings/emergency buffer, replenish when salary comes.

**Solution 2:** Build one month's PPF contribution as buffer.

| Month | Source | Deposit By |
|-------|--------|------------|
| April | Savings buffer | 5th April |
| May | April salary | 5th May |
| ... | Previous month salary | 5th of month |

## 15-Year Impact of Timing

### Scenario: ₹1.5 L/Year for 15 Years

| Deposit Timing | Total Invested | Maturity Value | Interest Earned |
|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| April 5th (lump sum) | ₹22.5 L | ₹40.68 L | ₹18.18 L |
| Monthly (before 5th) | ₹22.5 L | ₹38.87 L | ₹16.37 L |
| Monthly (after 5th) | ₹22.5 L | ₹38.21 L | ₹15.71 L |

**Lump sum timing earns ₹1.81 L more than monthly before 5th.**
**Monthly before 5th earns ₹66,000 more than monthly after 5th.**

## Other PPF Optimization Strategies

### 1. Avoid Deposits in Last Week of March

**Why:** Interest is credited on March 31st. Deposits in late March earn zero interest for that year.

| Deposit Date | Interest Impact |
|--------------|-----------------|
| March 1-5 | One month interest |
| March 6-31 | Zero interest until next year |

Better: Wait until April 1-5 for next year's interest.

### 2. Don't Let Account Go Inactive

Minimum ₹500/year is required. If you skip:
- Account becomes "discontinued"
- ₹50 penalty per year of default
- Interest still accrues but account is frozen

**Always deposit at least ₹500 by March 31st.**

### 3. Time Your Partial Withdrawals

From Year 7, you can withdraw up to 50% of balance. But consider:

| Withdrawal Timing | Interest Impact |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| Beginning of year | Lose full year's interest on amount |
| End of year | Minimal interest loss |

If you need to withdraw, do it in March rather than April.

### 4. Use the Loan Facility Wisely

Years 3-6, you can take a loan at PPF rate + 1%.

| Interest You Pay | PPF Interest You Earn |
|------------------|----------------------|
| 8.1% | 7.1% |

**Net cost: 1%**—but you lose compounding on the loaned amount. Use only for genuine emergencies.

### 5. Extend After Maturity (If Not Needed)

After 15 years, you can:
- Withdraw all (interest stops)
- Extend in 5-year blocks (interest continues)

**If you don't need the money, extend.** Your ₹40 L continues earning tax-free 7.1%.

| Extension | Year 20 Value | Additional Interest |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|
| Without contribution | ₹57.4 L | ₹16.7 L |
| With ₹1.5L/year contribution | ₹77.5 L | ₹14.6 L (new) + ₹16.7 L |

## Setting Up Auto-Debit for PPF

Most banks allow standing instructions for PPF:

### HDFC Bank
1. NetBanking → Accounts → PPF Account
2. Set up standing instruction
3. Choose 1st-4th of month

### SBI
1. OnlineSBI → Deposits → PPF
2. e-Transfer → Standing Instruction
3. Set date as 1st or 2nd

### ICICI Bank
1. NetBanking → Deposits & Investments → PPF
2. Schedule recurring transfer
3. Choose monthly, 1st-4th

**Pro tip:** Set it for 1st or 2nd to give buffer for holidays/weekends.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Depositing After 5th
Single biggest interest killer. Set reminders or auto-debit.

### 2. Spreading Small Deposits
Some people deposit ₹10,000 on 10th, then ₹2,500 on 25th. None of the second deposit earns that month's interest.

**Better:** One deposit before 5th.

### 3. Missing the March Deadline
Financial year ends March 31st. If you haven't deposited ₹1.5L:
- Deposit before March 5th: Earns March interest
- Deposit March 6-31: Earns zero March interest
- Miss March 31st: Lose entire year's 80C benefit

### 4. Depositing More Than ₹1.5 Lakh
Excess amount:
- Earns no interest
- Doesn't qualify for 80C
- Just sits there uselessly

### 5. Not Claiming 80C
PPF qualifies for Section 80C. If you forget to claim:
- At 30% bracket: ₹45,000 tax wasted
- Over 15 years: ₹6.75 L lost

## Quick Reference: PPF Deposit Calendar

| Task | Deadline | Why |
|------|----------|-----|
| Annual lump sum | April 1-5 | Maximum interest |
| Monthly deposit | 1st-5th of each month | Earn that month's interest |
| Minimum deposit | March 31st | Avoid discontinuation |
| 80C proof collection | January (for tax filing) | Don't miss deduction |
| Account extension | Before maturity | Continue earning |

## Conclusion

PPF optimization is simple but powerful:

| Action | Annual Benefit |
|--------|----------------|
| Deposit before 5th | ₹900-5,000 more interest |
| Lump sum vs monthly | ₹4,000-5,000 more interest |
| Never miss a year | ₹50 penalty avoided |
| Claim 80C | ₹45,000 tax saved (30% bracket) |

Over 15 years, these small optimizations add up to ₹1-2 lakh in additional returns. Set up your PPF deposit as a recurring task on the 1st of every month, and let the system work for you.
