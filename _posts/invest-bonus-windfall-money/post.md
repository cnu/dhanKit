You've received a bonus, inheritance, matured insurance policy, or sold property. Suddenly you have more money than usual. What now?

The wrong move (spending it all, leaving it in savings, or panicking into bad investments) can cost you lakhs. Here's a systematic approach.

## The Windfall Decision Framework

### Step 1: Pause Before Acting

| Windfall Size | Waiting Period | Why |
|---------------|----------------|-----|
| < ₹1 L | 1 week | Avoid impulse spending |
| ₹1-10 L | 2-4 weeks | Research options |
| ₹10-50 L | 1-2 months | Proper planning needed |
| ₹50 L+ | 3+ months | May need professional advice |

Park money in liquid fund or savings account while you plan.

**Calculate your investment growth:** Use our [Lumpsum Calculator](/lumpsum-calculator) to see potential returns.

### Step 2: Categorize the Windfall

| Source | Tax Implication | Emotional Factor |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Bonus | Taxable income | Expected, can plan |
| Property sale | Capital gains tax | May have attachment |
| Inheritance | Usually tax-free | Emotional weight |
| Lottery/gifts | May be taxable | Unexpected, exciting |
| Insurance maturity | Usually tax-free | Relief + opportunity |
| Retirement benefit | Partially taxable | Security concern |

Understanding the source helps with planning.

## The Allocation Framework

### Before Investing: The Priority Checklist

| Priority | Action | Amount |
|----------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Emergency fund | 6 months expenses |
| 2 | High-interest debt | Pay off completely |
| 3 | Health insurance | Adequate coverage |
| 4 | Term insurance | 10-15x annual income |
| 5 | Investment | Remaining amount |

**Don't invest until priorities 1-4 are covered.**

### Emergency Fund First

| Monthly Expenses | 6-Month Emergency Fund |
|------------------|------------------------|
| ₹30,000 | ₹1,80,000 |
| ₹50,000 | ₹3,00,000 |
| ₹75,000 | ₹4,50,000 |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹6,00,000 |

If you don't have this, windfall first goes here.

### High-Interest Debt Elimination

| Debt Type | Interest Rate | Action |
|-----------|---------------|--------|
| Credit card | 24-42% | Pay immediately |
| Personal loan | 12-18% | Pay immediately |
| Car loan | 9-12% | Consider paying |
| Home loan | 7-9% | Keep (tax benefit) |
| Education loan | 7-10% | Keep (tax benefit) |

**Math:** Paying off 15% loan = Guaranteed 15% return. No investment matches this.

## Investment Strategy by Windfall Size

### Small Windfall: ₹50,000-2 Lakh

| Allocation | Amount | Vehicle |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Emergency fund top-up | 30% | Liquid fund |
| Goal-based investment | 50% | Equity mutual fund |
| Treat yourself | 20% | Guilt-free spending |

**Example (₹1 L):**
- ₹30,000 → Liquid fund for emergencies
- ₹50,000 → Flexi-cap fund (lumpsum)
- ₹20,000 → Something you've wanted

### Medium Windfall: ₹2-10 Lakh

| Allocation | Amount | Strategy |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Debt clearance | As needed | Immediate |
| Emergency fund | 6 months | Liquid fund |
| Short-term goals (< 3 yr) | As needed | Debt funds |
| Long-term investment | Remaining | STP to equity |

**Example (₹5 L):**
- ₹1 L → Clear personal loan
- ₹1.5 L → Emergency fund top-up
- ₹50,000 → Upcoming expenses (travel, gadget)
- ₹2 L → 6-month STP to equity funds

### Large Windfall: ₹10-50 Lakh

| Component | Allocation | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Immediate needs | 10% | Debt, emergencies |
| Short-term (1-3 years) | 20% | Debt funds, FD |
| Medium-term (3-7 years) | 30% | Balanced/hybrid funds |
| Long-term (7+ years) | 40% | Equity via STP |

**Example (₹25 L):**
- ₹2.5 L → Clear all debt, top up emergency
- ₹5 L → FD ladder for upcoming expenses
- ₹7.5 L → Balanced advantage fund
- ₹10 L → 12-month STP to equity

### Very Large Windfall: ₹50 Lakh+

| Consideration | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Tax planning | Consult CA |
| Asset allocation | Diversify across asset classes |
| Real estate | Consider if goal-aligned |
| Professional advice | Consider fee-only advisor |

**Suggested allocation (₹1 Cr):**

| Asset Class | Allocation | Amount |
|-------------|------------|--------|
| Equity (Indian) | 40% | ₹40 L |
| Debt (FD, bonds, debt MF) | 25% | ₹25 L |
| International equity | 10% | ₹10 L |
| Gold | 10% | ₹10 L |
| Real estate/REITs | 10% | ₹10 L |
| Cash/Liquid | 5% | ₹5 L |

|--------|--------|------|
| Short-term debt fund | 6-8% | Low |
| Corporate bond fund | 7-9% | Low-moderate |
| Bank FD | 6-7% | Zero |

| Balanced advantage fund | 8-10% | Moderate |
| Aggressive hybrid fund | 9-11% | Moderate |

**Recommendation:** Balanced/hybrid funds for moderate growth with protection.

### Money Needed in 5+ Years

| Option | Return | Risk |
|--------|--------|------|

| Large-cap funds | 10-12% | Moderate-high |

**Recommendation:** Equity funds via STP (unless markets crashed).

**Calculate FD returns:** Use our [FD Calculator](/fd-calculator) for short-term goals.

## Common Windfall Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Lifestyle Inflation

| Behavior | Cost Over 10 Years |
|----------|-------------------|
| Upgrade car (₹5 L more) | ₹13 L (opportunity cost) |
| Bigger house rent (+₹20K/month) | ₹24 L |
| Lifestyle creep (+₹30K/month) | ₹36 L |

**Solution:** Allow 10-20% for lifestyle, invest the rest.

### Mistake 2: Leaving in Savings Account

| Duration | ₹10 L in Savings (3.5%) | ₹10 L in Equity (12%) | Lost |
|----------|-------------------------|------------------------|------|
| 5 years | ₹11.9 L | ₹17.6 L | ₹5.7 L |
| 10 years | ₹14.1 L | ₹31.1 L | ₹17 L |

Every month of delay costs you compounding returns.

### Mistake 3: Panic Investing

| Behavior | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Buying hot stock tip | Often crashes |
| Investing in friend's business | High failure rate |
| Real estate without research | Illiquid, may underperform |
| Insurance investment plans | Low returns, high lock-in |

**Solution:** Stick to diversified mutual funds.

### Mistake 4: Telling Everyone

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Relatives ask for loans | Awkward, potential loss |
| Friends expect treats | Drains windfall |
| "Investment advisors" appear | May be sold bad products |

**Solution:** Keep windfall private. Invest quietly.

### Mistake 5: No Clear Plan

| Without Plan | With Plan |
|--------------|-----------|
| Money slowly disappears | Allocated purposefully |
| Nothing to show in 2 years | Goals achieved |
| Regret | Satisfaction |

**Solution:** Write down allocation within 2 weeks.

## Windfall Investment Checklist

### Before Investing

| Check | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Waited at least 1-2 weeks | ☐ |
| Emergency fund adequate (6 months) | ☐ |
| High-interest debt cleared | ☐ |
| Health insurance in place | ☐ |
| Term insurance adequate | ☐ |
| Tax implications understood | ☐ |
| Written plan created | ☐ |

### Investment Decisions

| Check | Status |

| Allocated by time horizon | ☐ |
| Diversified (not single stock/fund) | ☐ |
| STP for large equity allocation | ☐ |
| Tax-efficient vehicles chosen | ☐ |

## Special Situations

### Inheritance

| Consideration | Action |
|---------------|--------|
| Emotional attachment | Take time to grieve/process |
| Family expectations | Clear communication |
| Existing investments | May need rebalancing |
| Tax implications | Usually tax-free, but verify |

**Tip:** It's okay to honor the person by using money wisely, not by keeping it idle.

### Bonus (Annual)

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Immediate lumpsum | Full year of returns | Timing risk |
| Add to existing SIPs | No timing risk | Miss lumpsum advantage |
| 50-50 split | Balanced | Neither maximized |

**Recommendation:** If bonus is < 30% of annual investments, lumpsum. If larger, split.

### Property Sale

| Priority | Action |
|----------|--------|
| 1 | Pay any capital gains tax |
| 2 | Clear outstanding home loan |
| 3 | Set aside for new property (if planned) |
| 4 | Invest remainder via STP |

**Note:** LTCG on property can be saved by reinvesting in new property (Section 54) or capital gains bonds (Section 54EC).

### Retirement Benefits (PF, Gratuity)

| Goal | Allocation |
|------|------------|
| Regular income needed | Debt funds + SWP |
| Growth with safety | Balanced funds |
| Long runway (early retirement) | Equity via STP |

**Warning:** This money must last 20-30 years. Be conservative.

4. Use STP for large equity allocations
5. Allow 10-20% for guilt-free enjoyment
6. Keep it private

A windfall is an opportunity to accelerate your financial goals. Treat it with respect, invest systematically, and let compounding work its magic.
