You have some extra money—a bonus, inheritance, or savings. Should you make a lump sum prepayment on your home loan, or increase your monthly EMI? Both reduce your loan tenure and interest, but which is more effective?

Let's do the math.

## Understanding the Two Strategies

### Lump Sum Prepayment
A one-time payment that directly reduces your principal. Your EMI stays the same, but the loan tenure decreases.

### Higher EMI
Increasing your monthly payment. Each EMI contains more principal repayment, reducing tenure gradually.

## Head-to-Head Comparison

**Scenario:** ₹50 lakh home loan, 8.5% interest, 20-year tenure

| Metric | Original Loan | With ₹5 L Prepayment | With ₹5,000 Higher EMI |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| EMI | ₹43,391 | ₹43,391 | ₹48,391 |
| Tenure | 240 months | 199 months | 197 months |
| Total interest | ₹54,13,840 | ₹41,30,247 | ₹40,29,977 |
| Interest saved | - | ₹12,83,593 | ₹13,83,863 |

**Surprise:** Higher EMI saves slightly more interest than the prepayment!

**But wait**—let's add timing to the analysis.

**Calculate your savings:** Use our [EMI Calculator](/emi-calculator) to see how prepayments affect your loan.

## The Timing Factor

### Prepayment Made in Year 1

| Metric | ₹5 L Prepayment (Year 1) | ₹5 L Prepayment (Year 10) |
|--------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Tenure reduction | 41 months | 26 months |
| Interest saved | ₹12,83,593 | ₹5,21,847 |

**Key insight:** Early prepayment saves more because it reduces principal when interest burden is highest.

### Higher EMI: Consistent Effect

Higher EMI works from day one, so timing isn't an issue—the benefit accrues automatically.

## Which Strategy When?

### Choose Lump Sum Prepayment If:

1. **You receive irregular windfalls**
   - Bonus, property sale, inheritance
   - One-time funds that won't repeat

2. **You're in early years of loan**
   - Maximum interest savings
   - Principal reduction has longest runway to compound

3. **You can't commit to higher EMI**
   - Income is variable
   - Job security concerns

4. **Large amount available**
   - Prepaying ₹5-10 L makes meaningful difference
   - Smaller amounts have less impact

### Choose Higher EMI If:

1. **You have stable, growing income**
   - Salaried with regular increments
   - Can sustain higher EMI long-term

2. **You want forced discipline**
   - EMI is automatically deducted
   - No temptation to spend the "extra" money

3. **Income just increased**
   - Promotion, new job
   - Lifestyle inflation alternative

4. **You can increase by 10%+ of current EMI**
   - Meaningful acceleration
   - Small increases have limited impact

## The Math: Detailed Scenarios

### Scenario A: ₹50 L Loan, ₹10 L Extra Over 5 Years

**Option 1: Annual Prepayments of ₹2 L**

| Year | Prepayment | Tenure After | Interest Saved |
|------|------------|--------------|----------------|
| 1 | ₹2,00,000 | 220 months | ₹5,52,000 |
| 2 | ₹2,00,000 | 200 months | ₹4,36,000 |
| 3 | ₹2,00,000 | 182 months | ₹3,42,000 |
| 4 | ₹2,00,000 | 164 months | ₹2,61,000 |
| 5 | ₹2,00,000 | 148 months | ₹1,93,000 |
| **Total** | **₹10,00,000** | **148 months** | **₹17,84,000** |

**Option 2: Higher EMI (₹16,667/month extra)**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| New EMI | ₹60,058 |
| Original tenure | 240 months |
| New tenure | 142 months |
| Interest saved | ₹19,21,000 |

**Winner:** Higher EMI saves ₹1,37,000 more.

### Scenario B: Same ₹10 L, Lump Sum vs Spread

**Option 1: ₹10 L Prepayment in Year 1**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tenure reduction | 68 months |
| New tenure | 172 months |
| Interest saved | ₹21,47,000 |

**Option 2: ₹10 L Prepayment in Year 5**

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Tenure reduction | 51 months |
| New tenure | 189 months |
| Interest saved | ₹14,32,000 |

**Winner:** Early prepayment saves ₹7,15,000 more than delayed prepayment.

## The Optimal Strategy: Hybrid Approach

The best approach combines both strategies:

1. **Increase EMI** by 5-10% annually (linked to salary growth)
2. **Make prepayments** whenever you receive lump sums
3. **Prioritize early prepayments** over investments giving <8.5% returns

### Example Hybrid Plan

| Year | Base EMI | Step-Up | Bonus Prepayment | Total Extra |
|------|----------|---------|------------------|-------------|
| 1 | ₹43,391 | - | ₹1,00,000 | ₹1,00,000 |
| 2 | ₹47,730 | ₹4,339 | ₹1,50,000 | ₹2,02,068 |
| 3 | ₹52,503 | ₹4,773 | ₹1,50,000 | ₹2,07,276 |
| 4 | ₹57,753 | ₹5,250 | ₹2,00,000 | ₹2,63,000 |
| 5 | ₹63,528 | ₹5,775 | ₹2,00,000 | ₹2,69,300 |

**Result:** Loan closed in ~12 years instead of 20, saving ₹28+ lakh in interest.

## When Prepayment Doesn't Make Sense

### 1. Your Loan Rate is Low
If your home loan rate is 7% and you can earn 12% in equity, investing may be better.

| Loan Rate | Equity Return | Better Choice |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 9%+ | 12% | Prepay |
| 7-9% | 12% | Invest (marginally) |
| <7% | 12% | Definitely invest |

### 2. You Lose Tax Benefit
Home loan interest up to ₹2 L gets 80C deduction. If prepayment reduces interest below ₹2 L, you lose tax benefit.

| Tax Bracket | Effective Loan Cost (8.5% rate) |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 30% | 8.5% - (8.5% × 30%) = 5.95% |
| 20% | 8.5% - (8.5% × 20%) = 6.8% |
| 5% | 8.5% - (8.5% × 5%) = 8.08% |

At 30% bracket, your effective rate is only 5.95%—lower than most safe investments.

### 3. No Emergency Fund
Don't prepay if you don't have 6 months' expenses saved. Liquidity matters more than interest savings.

### 4. High-Interest Debt Exists
Pay off personal loans (12-18%) and credit cards (24-40%) before home loan prepayment.

## Banks' Perspective: Why They Allow Prepayment

Most banks now allow prepayment without penalty (RBI mandate for floating rate loans). But they're not doing you a favor—they prefer:

1. **Higher EMI** over prepayment (keeps you as a longer-term customer)
2. **Part prepayment** over full closure (some revenue continues)

Always confirm:
- No prepayment penalty
- No minimum prepayment amount
- Prepayment reduces principal, not just future interest

## Prepayment Rules to Know

### Floating Rate Loans
- No prepayment penalty allowed (RBI rule)
- Can prepay any amount, any time

### Fixed Rate Loans
- Banks can charge up to 2% penalty
- Check your loan agreement

### Part Prepayment Process
1. Check outstanding balance via netbanking
2. Calculate desired prepayment amount
3. Transfer to loan account (or use bank's prepayment portal)
4. Request new amortization schedule
5. Verify tenure reduction

## Action Plan

### If You Have a Home Loan:

**Step 1:** Get current amortization schedule
- Note total interest remaining
- Note current principal outstanding

**Step 2:** Calculate affordability
- Can you increase EMI by 10%?
- Do you have lump sum available?

**Step 3:** Choose strategy

| Your Situation | Strategy |
|----------------|----------|
| Stable job, regular income | Increase EMI by 10% |
| Variable income, occasional bonuses | Prepay when possible |
| High loan rate (9%+) | Aggressive prepayment |
| Low loan rate (<7.5%), high tax bracket | Consider investing instead |

**Step 4:** Execute and track
- Set up higher EMI (contact bank)
- Or make prepayment
- Get revised schedule
- Track interest savings

## Conclusion

Both prepayment and higher EMI reduce your loan burden—the difference is usually marginal (5-10%). What matters more:

1. **Do something:** Any extra payment beats doing nothing
2. **Start early:** Interest savings compound over time
3. **Be consistent:** Regular higher EMI beats sporadic prepayments
4. **Stay liquid:** Don't compromise emergency fund for prepayment

The best strategy is the one you'll actually follow.
