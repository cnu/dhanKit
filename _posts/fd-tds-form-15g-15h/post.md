You open a Fixed Deposit expecting ₹50,000 in interest, but only receive ₹45,000. Where did ₹5,000 go? TDS—Tax Deducted at Source.

Understanding FD taxation can save you from unnecessary deductions and help you claim refunds. Let's decode it.

## How FD Interest is Taxed

FD interest is fully taxable at your income tax slab rate. There's no special treatment like equity LTCG.

| Your Tax Bracket | Tax on ₹50,000 FD Interest |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| No tax (income < ₹2.5L) | ₹0 |
| 5% | ₹2,500 |
| 20% | ₹10,000 |
| 30% | ₹15,000 |

**Key point:** Banks deduct TDS at 10%, but your actual tax depends on your slab. This creates refund/additional payment scenarios.

## TDS on FD: The Basics

### When is TDS Deducted?

Banks deduct TDS when total interest across all FDs with that bank exceeds ₹40,000 in a financial year.

| Category | TDS Threshold |
|----------|---------------|
| Regular individuals | ₹40,000/year |
| Senior citizens (60+) | ₹50,000/year |

### TDS Rate

| Situation | TDS Rate |
|-----------|----------|
| PAN provided | 10% |
| PAN not provided | 20% |

**Always provide PAN** to your bank to avoid 20% TDS.

### When is TDS Deducted (Timing)?

| FD Type | TDS Timing |
|---------|------------|
| Cumulative FD | At maturity or yearly, whichever is earlier |
| Non-cumulative (quarterly payout) | When interest is paid |

**Important:** For cumulative FDs, banks calculate annual interest and deduct TDS yearly, even though you don't receive the money until maturity.

## Form 15G and 15H: Avoid TDS Legally

If your total income is below the taxable limit, you can submit Form 15G/15H to prevent TDS deduction altogether.

### Form 15G: For Individuals Below 60

**Eligibility:**
- Must be resident individual (not company/firm)
- Age below 60
- Tax on total estimated income is NIL
- Total interest income doesn't exceed basic exemption limit

| For FY 2024-25 | Exemption Limit |
|----------------|-----------------|
| General | ₹2,50,000 |
| Under new regime | ₹3,00,000 |

### Form 15H: For Senior Citizens (60+)

**Eligibility:**
- Must be resident senior citizen (60+)
- Tax on total estimated income is NIL

| For FY 2024-25 | Exemption Limit |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Senior citizens (60-80) | ₹3,00,000 |
| Super senior (80+) | ₹5,00,000 |

### How to Submit Form 15G/15H

**Option 1: Online (Recommended)**
1. Log into your bank's net banking
2. Navigate to "Tax Center" or "Form 15G/15H"
3. Fill details and submit digitally
4. Download acknowledgment

**Option 2: Branch Submission**
1. Download form from bank website or Income Tax portal
2. Fill in duplicate
3. Submit to branch before FD maturity
4. Keep acknowledgment copy

### When to Submit

| FD Type | Submit By |
|---------|-----------|
| New FD | At the time of opening |
| Existing FD | Before financial year starts (April) |
| Renewal | Before renewal date |

**Important:** Form 15G/15H is valid for one financial year only. Submit fresh form every April.

## Detailed Form 15G Walkthrough

### Part I: Details to Fill

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| Name of assessee | Your full name as per PAN |
| PAN | Your 10-digit PAN |
| Status | Individual |
| Previous year | FY for which form is submitted |
| Residential status | Resident |
| Flat/Door/Building | Your address |
| Assessed in which ward | Leave blank if not known |
| Estimated income | FD interest expected this year |
| Estimated total income | All income sources added |
| Number of Form 15G filed | If submitting to multiple banks |

### Part II: Declaration

| Field | What to Enter |
|-------|---------------|
| Name and address of payer | Bank name and branch |
| Amount of income | Expected FD interest from this bank |

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Wrong financial year** - Form for FY 2024-25 should mention "2024-25"
2. **Underestimating income** - If actual income exceeds estimate, you'll face penalty
3. **Submitting when not eligible** - If total income is taxable, don't submit
4. **Not submitting to all banks** - Submit to each bank separately

## What If TDS is Already Deducted?

### Step 1: Check Form 26AS

Form 26AS shows all TDS deducted against your PAN. Access via:
- Income Tax e-filing portal
- Net banking (most banks provide)

### Step 2: Claim Credit in ITR

When filing ITR:
1. Report FD interest as "Income from Other Sources"
2. TDS from 26AS auto-populates
3. Calculate tax liability
4. TDS gets adjusted against tax payable

### Step 3: Get Refund (If Applicable)

If TDS exceeds your tax liability:
1. File ITR correctly
2. Claim refund in ITR
3. Refund processed to bank account (4-6 weeks usually)

## Special Cases

### Multiple FDs Across Banks

| Bank | FD Interest | TDS Threshold | TDS Deducted |
|------|-------------|---------------|--------------|
| SBI | ₹30,000 | ₹40,000 | ₹0 |
| HDFC | ₹35,000 | ₹40,000 | ₹0 |
| ICICI | ₹25,000 | ₹40,000 | ₹0 |
| **Total** | **₹90,000** | - | **₹0** |

**Trap:** No individual bank crosses ₹40,000, so no TDS. But total ₹90,000 is taxable. You must pay tax when filing ITR.

### Corporate FDs (NBFCs)

| Difference | Bank FD | Corporate FD |
|------------|---------|--------------|
| TDS threshold | ₹40,000 | ₹5,000 |
| TDS rate | 10% | 10% |
| Safety | DICGC insured | Not insured |

Corporate FDs have much lower TDS threshold—₹5,000 vs ₹40,000.

### NRI FD Taxation

| FD Type | TDS Rate | Form to Avoid |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| NRE FD | No TDS | Not needed (interest is tax-free) |
| NRO FD | 30% | Not applicable (TDS mandatory) |

NRIs cannot submit Form 15G/15H for NRO accounts.

## Tax-Efficient FD Strategies

### 1. Split FDs Across Family Members

Instead of ₹10 L in your name:
- ₹3.33 L in your name
- ₹3.33 L in spouse's name
- ₹3.33 L in parent's name

Each person stays below ₹40,000 threshold.

**Caution:** Clubbing provisions apply for spouse/minor. Consult tax advisor.

### 2. Choose Senior Citizen FDs

If you're 60+:
- Higher interest rate (0.25-0.5% extra)
- Higher TDS threshold (₹50,000 vs ₹40,000)
- Form 15H easier eligibility

### 3. Consider Tax-Saver FD

5-year tax-saver FD gives Section 80C benefit:
- Lock-in: 5 years
- Deduction: Up to ₹1.5 lakh
- Interest: Still taxable

Effective return improves due to tax deduction on principal.

### 4. Time Your FDs

For cumulative FDs, timing matters:
- FD maturing in March: Full interest taxed in that year
- FD maturing in April: Interest spreads across years

## FD vs Debt Mutual Fund: Tax Comparison

| Factor | FD | Debt Mutual Fund |
|--------|-----|------------------|
| Taxation | At slab rate | At slab rate (post 2023) |
| TDS | Yes (above ₹40K) | No TDS |
| Flexibility | Penalty on premature | No exit load (most liquid funds) |
| Returns | 6-7.5% | 6-8% |

Post-2023 debt fund changes, FD and debt funds have similar taxation. Choose based on liquidity needs.

## Conclusion

Key takeaways for FD taxation:

| Your Situation | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| Income below taxable limit | Submit Form 15G/15H |
| Senior citizen, low income | Submit Form 15H |
| High tax bracket | Plan for additional tax payment |
| Multiple banks | Track total interest across all |
| TDS already deducted, refund due | File ITR and claim refund |

Don't let TDS surprise you. Either prevent it with 15G/15H or plan for it in your tax calculations.
