How much should you invest in equity vs debt? This asset allocation decision is more important than picking individual funds.

Studies show that asset allocation determines up to 90% of portfolio returns variability. Here's how to get it right.

## The Basics: Debt vs Equity

### Characteristics Comparison

| Factor | Equity | Debt |
|--------|--------|------|
| Returns | 10-14% | 6-9% |
| Risk | High volatility | Low volatility |
| Short-term | Can drop 30-50% | Stable (2-5% movement) |
| Long-term | Usually positive | Consistent |
| Inflation hedge | Good | Moderate |
| Liquidity | High | Varies |

**Calculate potential returns:** Use our [SIP Calculator](/sip-calculator) for equity and [FD Calculator](/fd-calculator) for debt.

### Return Comparison: ₹10,000/Month for 20 Years

| Allocation | Expected Return | Corpus |
|------------|-----------------|--------|
| 100% Equity | 12% | ₹1 Cr |
| 80% Equity, 20% Debt | 11% | ₹86 L |
| 60% Equity, 40% Debt | 9.5% | ₹70 L |
| 40% Equity, 60% Debt | 8% | ₹59 L |
| 100% Debt | 7% | ₹52 L |

**Higher equity = Higher returns (with more volatility).**

## Classic Allocation Rules

### The Age-Based Rule

**Rule:** Equity % = 100 - Your Age

| Age | Equity | Debt |
|-----|--------|------|
| 25 | 75% | 25% |
| 35 | 65% | 35% |
| 45 | 55% | 45% |
| 55 | 45% | 55% |
| 65 | 35% | 65% |

**Modern variation:** Equity % = 110 - Age (due to longer lifespans)

### The Life Stage Rule

| Life Stage | Equity | Debt | Reasoning |
|------------|--------|------|-----------|
| Early career (22-30) | 80-90% | 10-20% | Long horizon, can recover |
| Growth phase (30-40) | 70-80% | 20-30% | Building wealth, some stability |
| Peak earning (40-50) | 60-70% | 30-40% | Balancing growth and protection |
| Pre-retirement (50-60) | 40-60% | 40-60% | Protecting accumulated wealth |
| Retirement (60+) | 30-40% | 60-70% | Income focus, capital preservation |

### The Risk-Based Rule

| Risk Tolerance | Equity | Debt | Suitable For |
|----------------|--------|------|--------------|
| Aggressive | 80-100% | 0-20% | Young, high-income, no dependents |
| Moderately aggressive | 70-80% | 20-30% | Long horizon, comfortable with volatility |
| Moderate | 50-70% | 30-50% | Balanced approach, some concerns |
| Conservative | 30-50% | 50-70% | Near retirement, low risk tolerance |
| Very conservative | 10-30% | 70-90% | Retired, need capital safety |

## Building Your Asset Allocation

### Step 1: Assess Your Factors

| Factor | Increases Equity | Increases Debt |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Age | Younger | Older |
| Income stability | Stable job | Variable income |
| Dependents | None/few | Many |
| Other assets | Have property/pension | Only financial assets |
| Risk tolerance | High | Low |
| Goals | Long-term | Short-term |

### Step 2: Scoring Method

| Factor | Score 1 (More Debt) | Score 5 (More Equity) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Age | > 55 | < 35 |
| Job stability | Unstable | Very stable |
| Dependents | 3+ | 0 |
| Emergency fund | < 3 months | > 6 months |
| Investment horizon | < 5 years | > 15 years |
| Comfort with 30% drop | Would panic | Would buy more |

**Average score:**
- 4-5: 80-90% equity
- 3-4: 60-80% equity
- 2-3: 40-60% equity
- 1-2: 20-40% equity

### Step 3: Practical Allocations

| Profile | Sample Allocation |
|---------|-------------------|
| 28-year-old, single, stable job | 85% equity, 15% debt |
| 35-year-old, married, 1 child | 70% equity, 30% debt |
| 45-year-old, 2 kids in school | 60% equity, 40% debt |
| 55-year-old, pre-retirement | 45% equity, 55% debt |
| 65-year-old, retired | 30% equity, 70% debt |

## Equity Allocation Breakdown

### Within Equity

| Category | Aggressive | Moderate | Conservative |
|----------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Large-cap | 30% | 50% | 70% |
| Mid-cap | 30% | 30% | 20% |
| Small-cap | 25% | 15% | 5% |
| International | 15% | 5% | 5% |

### Implementation

| Allocation | Fund Type |
|------------|-----------|
| Large-cap | Nifty 50 index fund, large-cap fund |
| Mid-cap | Mid-cap index/active fund |
| Small-cap | Small-cap fund (limited) |
| Flexi-cap | For simplicity (single fund) |

## Debt Allocation Breakdown

### Within Debt

| Category | Conservative | Moderate | Growth |
|----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Liquid funds | 30% | 20% | 10% |
| Short-duration | 30% | 30% | 20% |
| Corporate bonds | 20% | 30% | 40% |
| PPF/FD | 20% | 20% | 30% |

### Purpose-Based Debt Allocation

| Purpose | Instrument |
|---------|------------|
| Emergency fund | Liquid fund |
| Short-term goals | Ultra-short, short-duration |
| Medium-term stability | Corporate bond, banking PSU |
| Long-term safety | PPF, debt funds |

## Rebalancing Your Portfolio

### Why Rebalance?

| Scenario | Without Rebalancing | With Rebalancing |
|----------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Bull market | Equity grows to 85% | Maintain 70% (sell some) |
| Bear market | Equity falls to 55% | Maintain 70% (buy more) |
| Result | Risk increases/decreases | Risk stays consistent |

### Rebalancing Methods

| Method | Trigger | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Calendar | Every year | Rebalance to target |
| Threshold | ±5% deviation | Rebalance when breached |
| Combination | Annual + threshold | Best of both |

### Rebalancing Example

**Target: 70% Equity, 30% Debt | Portfolio: ₹10 L**

| Start | After Bull Market | After Rebalancing |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Equity: ₹7 L | Equity: ₹9.1 L (76%) | Equity: ₹8.4 L (70%) |
| Debt: ₹3 L | Debt: ₹2.9 L (24%) | Debt: ₹3.6 L (30%) |
| Total: ₹10 L | Total: ₹12 L | Total: ₹12 L |

**Action:** Sell ₹70K equity, buy ₹70K debt.

## Age-Based Glide Path

### The Glide Path Concept

Gradually reduce equity as you age, following a predetermined path.

| Age | Equity | Debt | Adjustment |
|-----|--------|------|------------|
| 25 | 85% | 15% | Start |
| 30 | 80% | 20% | -5% equity |
| 35 | 75% | 25% | -5% equity |
| 40 | 70% | 30% | -5% equity |
| 45 | 60% | 40% | -10% equity |
| 50 | 50% | 50% | -10% equity |
| 55 | 40% | 60% | -10% equity |
| 60 | 35% | 65% | -5% equity |

### Implementing the Glide Path

| Method | How It Works |
|--------|--------------|
| SIP allocation change | Redirect new investments |
| Annual switch | Switch accumulated funds |
| Target date fund | Automatic (but limited options in India) |

## Special Situations

### When You Have EPF

| Total Debt = EPF + PPF + FD + Debt MF

If EPF is large, you can take more equity elsewhere.

| EPF Balance | Additional Debt Needed |
|-------------|------------------------|
| ₹20 L | Less debt in MF |
| ₹50 L | Minimal additional debt |
| ₹1 Cr | Focus equity in MF |

### When You Have Real Estate

Real estate is a leveraged, illiquid asset.

| Situation | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| Have property (home) | Reduce equity slightly |
| Have investment property | Consider as alternative asset |
| Large home loan | Build liquid assets faster |

### Market Conditions

| Market State | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| High valuations (PE > 25) | Don't increase equity % |
| Fair valuations (PE 18-22) | Stick to target |
| Low valuations (PE < 18) | Consider increasing equity |

**But:** Don't time excessively. Stick to your allocation mostly.

## Common Allocation Mistakes

### 1. Too Conservative Too Young

| Age | Bad Allocation | Good Allocation | 25-Year Difference |
|-----|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| 25 | 40% equity | 80% equity | ₹35 L vs ₹75 L |

**Young people can afford volatility** - they have decades to recover.

### 2. Too Aggressive Too Old

| Age | Bad Allocation | Risk |
|-----|----------------|------|
| 55 | 90% equity | 40% crash = retirement delayed |

**Near retirement, protect** what you've built.

### 3. Not Rebalancing

| Situation | Problem |
|-----------|---------|
| Bull market gains | Portfolio becomes too risky |
| Bear market losses | Portfolio becomes too conservative |

**Rebalance annually** at minimum.

### 4. Emotional Changes

| Market | Emotional Response | Correct Response |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Crash | "Sell everything!" | Rebalance (buy equity) |
| Bull run | "Go all in!" | Rebalance (sell equity) |

**Stick to your plan.**
