| Future withdrawals | Based on reduced balance |

**Balance: ₹10 L, Withdraw ₹2 L in Year 8:**
- Post-withdrawal balance: ₹8 L
- Year 9 interest (7.1%): ₹56,800 (vs ₹71,000 without withdrawal)
- Lost interest over 7 years: ~₹1.2 L

**Think carefully** before withdrawing - you lose future compounding.
