You've contributed to NPS for years. Now you're approaching 60, and it's time to understand the exit rules. How much can you withdraw? What happens to the rest?

NPS exit rules are specific—and understanding them is crucial to maximize your retirement income.

## NPS Exit Rules at Age 60

### The 60-40 Split

| Component | Percentage | Treatment |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Lumpsum withdrawal | Up to 60% | Tax-free |
| Annuity purchase | Minimum 40% | Taxable as pension |

**Key point:** You MUST buy an annuity with at least 40% of your corpus. The remaining 60% is your choice.

**Calculate your NPS corpus:** Use our [NPS Calculator](/nps-calculator) to see your expected retirement amount.

### What You Can Do with the 60%

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Full lumpsum | Withdraw all 60% at once (tax-free) |
| Phased withdrawal | Withdraw in installments until age 75 |
| Leave in NPS | Continue investing (now allowed till 75) |
| Mix | Partial lumpsum + phased withdrawal |

### Small Corpus Exception

| Corpus Size | Special Rule |
|-------------|--------------|
| ≤ ₹5 lakh | Can withdraw 100% as lumpsum |
| > ₹5 lakh | Must follow 60-40 rule |

**If corpus is small, you're not forced to buy an annuity.**

## Understanding Annuity

### What is Annuity?

An annuity is a financial product where you give a lump sum to an insurance company, and they pay you a fixed monthly pension for life (or a specified period).

| Feature | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Provider | Life insurance companies |
| Payment | Monthly/quarterly/annually |
| Duration | Lifetime or fixed period |
| Rate | 5-7% typically |

### Annuity Options Available

| Option | How It Works | Best For |
|--------|--------------|----------|
| Life annuity | Pension till death | Single person |
| Life annuity with return of corpus | Pension + corpus to nominee | Married with dependents |
| Joint life annuity | Pension to you, then spouse | Married couples |
| Annuity certain | Pension for fixed years (5/10/15/20) | Those with other income |
| Annuity with annual increase | Pension increases 3% yearly | Inflation protection |

### Annuity Rate Comparison (Indicative)

| Annuity Type | Rate (Age 60) | Monthly from ₹40 L |
|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Life annuity only | 6.5-7% | ₹21,667-23,333 |
| Life + return of corpus | 5.5-6% | ₹18,333-20,000 |
| Joint life | 5-5.5% | ₹16,667-18,333 |
| With 3% increase | 4.5-5% | ₹15,000-16,667 (year 1) |

**Lower rate = more features (spouse coverage, return of capital, inflation adjustment).**

## Tax Treatment

### Lumpsum (60%) - Tax-Free

| Component | Tax Status |
|-----------|------------|
| Employer contribution | Tax-free |
| Employee contribution | Tax-free |
| Returns on both | Tax-free |

**Entire 60% lumpsum is tax-free at withdrawal.**

### Annuity (40%) - Taxable

| Component | Tax Treatment |
|-----------|---------------|
| Monthly pension | Added to income |
| Tax rate | Your slab rate |
| TDS | Applicable on pension |

**Annuity income is fully taxable** at your applicable slab rate.

## Strategies for NPS Exit

### Strategy 1: Maximize Tax-Free Lumpsum

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Take full 60% lumpsum | ₹60 L tax-free |
| Buy minimum 40% annuity | Meets requirement |
| Invest lumpsum in SWP | Create own "pension" |

**Why this works:** SWP from equity/balanced funds may give better returns than annuity.

### Strategy 2: Higher Annuity for Security

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Take 40% lumpsum | Keep emergency buffer |
| Buy 60% annuity | Higher guaranteed pension |

**Why this works:** More guaranteed income, less market risk.

### Strategy 3: Phased Withdrawal

| Year | Withdrawal from 60% | Remaining in NPS |
|------|---------------------|------------------|
| 60 | 10% (₹6 L) | 50% continues |
| 61-65 | 10%/year (₹6 L each) | Reducing |
| 66+ | Remaining as needed | - |

**Why this works:** Keeps money invested longer, draws as needed.

### Strategy 4: Defer Exit

| Action | Benefit |
|--------|---------|
| Continue NPS till 75 | More accumulation years |
| Keep contributing | Corpus grows |
| Delay annuity purchase | May get better rates |

**Why this works:** Allowed to stay invested till 75 now.

## Lumpsum vs SWP: What to Do with 60%

### Option A: Invest in SWP

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Investment | Balanced/equity mutual fund |
| Withdrawal rate | 4-5% annually |
| Expected return | 8-10% |
| Corpus growth | Possible if returns > withdrawal |
| Risk | Market risk |

### Option B: Keep in FD/Debt

| Factor | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Investment | Bank FD, debt funds |
| Return | 6-7% |
| Risk | Very low |
| Corpus | Depletes over time |

### Comparison for ₹60 L Lumpsum

| Option | Monthly Income | After 20 Years |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| FD (6.5%) | ₹32,500 | Principal eroding |
| SWP (9% return, 5% withdrawal) | ₹25,000 | Corpus grown to ₹80 L+ |
| Annuity (6%) | ₹30,000 | Principal gone at death |

**SWP may outperform** but has market risk. Annuity has no risk but no growth.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Choosing Annuity Without Comparing

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Taking first offer | May get lower rate | Compare 3-5 providers |
| Not negotiating | Missing better terms | Ask for better rates |

### 2. Wrong Annuity Type

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Life only (when married) | Spouse gets nothing | Choose joint life |
| Joint life (when single) | Lower rate for no benefit | Choose life only |

### 3. Not Considering Inflation

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Fixed annuity at 60 | ₹20K today = ₹7K value at 80 | Consider increasing annuity |

### 4. Withdrawing Everything Immediately

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Full 60% lumpsum at once | May spend unwisely | Phased withdrawal |
| Lifestyle inflation | Money runs out | Planned withdrawals |
