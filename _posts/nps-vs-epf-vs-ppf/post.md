## Corpus Comparison: Real Scenarios

### Scenario 1: ₹50,000 Monthly Salary, 30 Years

| Investment | Monthly Contribution | Corpus at 60 |
|------------|---------------------|--------------|
| EPF (12% + 12%) | ₹12,000 | ₹2.28 Cr |
| NPS (₹2L/year, 70% E) | ₹16,667 | ₹2.08 Cr |
| PPF (₹1.5L/year) | ₹12,500 | ₹1.03 Cr |

### Scenario 2: Combined Portfolio (Same Salary)

| Investment | Contribution | Corpus |
|------------|--------------|--------|
| EPF | ₹12,000/month | ₹2.28 Cr |
| NPS | ₹4,167/month (₹50K/year) | ₹52 L |
| PPF | ₹6,250/month (₹75K/year) | ₹52 L |
| **Total** | ₹22,417/month | **₹3.32 Cr** |

## The EEE vs EET Debate

### What It Means

| Status | Contribution | Growth | Withdrawal |
|--------|--------------|--------|------------|
| EEE (PPF, EPF) | Exempt | Exempt | Exempt |
| EET (NPS) | Exempt | Exempt | Taxable (40% annuity) |

### Does It Matter?

| Investment | Tax Advantage | Return Advantage | Net Advantage |
|------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|
| PPF (EEE, 7.1%) | Best tax | Lower returns | Moderate |
| NPS (EET, 11%) | Partial tax on exit | Higher returns | Better for most |

**NPS higher returns often outweigh the partial tax** on exit.

### Example: ₹50K/Year for 25 Years

| Investment | Corpus | Tax on Exit | Net Amount |
|------------|--------|-------------|------------|
| PPF (7.1%) | ₹26 L | ₹0 | ₹26 L |
| NPS (11%, 60% free) | ₹52 L | ~₹3.5 L on annuity | ~₹48.5 L |

**NPS creates nearly 2x wealth** despite partial taxation.

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Ignoring NPS 80CCD(1B)

| Mistake | Cost (30% bracket) |
|---------|-------------------|
| Not using ₹50K 80CCD(1B) | ₹15,600/year tax loss |
| Over 25 years | ₹3.9 L + opportunity cost |

### 2. VPF When NPS Available

| Option | Return | Tax Benefit |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| VPF | 8.25% | Within 80C |
| NPS | 8-12% | 80CCD(1B) additional |

**NPS often better** than VPF for additional retirement savings.

### 3. PPF Over NPS for Young Investors

| Age 25 Investor | PPF (7.1%) | NPS (11%) |
|-----------------|------------|-----------|
| ₹1 L/year, 35 years | ₹1.38 Cr | ₹3.41 Cr |

**NPS can create 2.5x more** with higher equity allocation.
