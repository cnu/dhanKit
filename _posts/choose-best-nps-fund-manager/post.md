## Performance Comparison: Equity (E) Class

The equity class is where fund managers have the most room to differentiate.

### 5-Year Returns (Annualized)

| Fund Manager | 5-Year Return | Rank |
|--------------|---------------|------|
| HDFC Pension Fund | 15.8% | 1 |
| ICICI Pru Pension Fund | 15.2% | 2 |
| Kotak Pension Fund | 14.9% | 3 |
| SBI Pension Fund | 14.5% | 4 |
| UTI Retirement Solutions | 14.2% | 5 |
| Axis Pension Fund | 13.8% | 6 |
| LIC Pension Fund | 13.5% | 7 |

### 10-Year Returns (Annualized)

| Fund Manager | 10-Year Return | Rank |
|--------------|----------------|------|
| SBI Pension Fund | 12.8% | 1 |
| HDFC Pension Fund | 12.5% | 2 |
| UTI Retirement Solutions | 12.3% | 3 |
| ICICI Pru Pension Fund | 12.1% | 4 |
| Kotak Pension Fund | 11.9% | 5 |
| LIC Pension Fund | 11.6% | 6 |
| Axis Pension Fund | 11.4% | 7 |

**Observation:** Rankings shift over time. Recent top performers may not be long-term leaders.

## Performance Comparison: Corporate Bonds (C) Class

| Fund Manager | 5-Year Return | 10-Year Return |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| SBI Pension Fund | 9.2% | 9.5% |
| HDFC Pension Fund | 9.1% | 9.3% |
| ICICI Pru Pension Fund | 9.0% | 9.2% |
| Kotak Pension Fund | 8.9% | 9.1% |
| UTI Retirement Solutions | 8.8% | 9.0% |
| Axis Pension Fund | 8.7% | 8.9% |
| LIC Pension Fund | 8.6% | 8.8% |

**Observation:** Much tighter range (0.6% spread). Fund manager choice matters less for debt.

## Performance Comparison: Government Securities (G) Class

| Fund Manager | 5-Year Return | 10-Year Return |
|--------------|---------------|----------------|
| SBI Pension Fund | 8.8% | 9.2% |
| LIC Pension Fund | 8.7% | 9.1% |
| UTI Retirement Solutions | 8.6% | 9.0% |
| HDFC Pension Fund | 8.5% | 8.9% |
| ICICI Pru Pension Fund | 8.4% | 8.8% |
| Kotak Pension Fund | 8.3% | 8.7% |
| Axis Pension Fund | 8.2% | 8.6% |

**Observation:** G-Sec returns are nearly identical. Public sector funds have a slight edge.

## Does Fund Manager Choice Really Matter?

### The Honest Answer: It Matters Most for Equity

| Asset Class | Return Spread | Impact on ₹50L Corpus |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| Equity (E) | 2-3% | ₹10-15 L difference |
| Corporate Bonds (C) | 0.5-0.7% | ₹2-3 L difference |
| Government Securities (G) | 0.4-0.6% | ₹1-2 L difference |

For a 25-year NPS journey, choosing the right equity fund manager can mean ₹10-15 lakh more at retirement.

### But Consistency Matters More

| Fund Manager | Rank in Year 1 | Rank in Year 3 | Rank in Year 5 |
|--------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| HDFC PF | 2 | 1 | 1 |
| SBI PF | 1 | 3 | 4 |
| ICICI Pru PF | 4 | 2 | 2 |
| Kotak PF | 3 | 4 | 3 |

Rankings fluctuate. Chasing last year's top performer often backfires.

## How to Choose Your Fund Manager

### Criteria 1: Long-Term Track Record

Look at 7-10 year returns, not just recent performance.

| Good Sign | Red Flag |
|-----------|----------|
| Consistently in top 3 | Volatile rankings |
| Steady returns | Huge swings |
| Large AUM | Declining AUM |

### Criteria 2: Fund Size (AUM)

Larger AUM generally indicates trust and stability.

| Fund Manager | Equity AUM | Total AUM |
|--------------|------------|-----------|
| SBI Pension Fund | ₹1.2 L Cr+ | ₹3.5 L Cr |
| LIC Pension Fund | ₹80,000 Cr | ₹2.8 L Cr |
| UTI Retirement Solutions | ₹35,000 Cr | ₹90,000 Cr |
| HDFC Pension Fund | ₹25,000 Cr | ₹65,000 Cr |
| ICICI Pru Pension Fund | ₹20,000 Cr | ₹55,000 Cr |
| Kotak Pension Fund | ₹15,000 Cr | ₹40,000 Cr |
| Axis Pension Fund | ₹8,000 Cr | ₹20,000 Cr |

### Criteria 3: Investment Style

| Fund Manager | Style | Best For |
|--------------|-------|----------|
| SBI PF | Conservative, index-hugging | Risk-averse investors |
| HDFC PF | Growth-oriented | Higher return seekers |
| ICICI Pru PF | Balanced | Middle-ground investors |
| Kotak PF | Quality-focused | Stability seekers |
| LIC PF | Conservative | Government employee default |

### Criteria 4: Expense Ratio

NPS has very low expenses, but there are small differences:

| Fund Manager | Expense Ratio |
|--------------|---------------|
| SBI PF | 0.01% |
| LIC PF | 0.01% |
| UTI RS | 0.01% |
| HDFC PF | 0.02% |
| ICICI Pru PF | 0.02% |
| Kotak PF | 0.03% |
| Axis PF | 0.03% |

Difference is negligible—don't let 0.01% difference drive your decision.

## My Recommendation by Investor Type

| Why | Reason |

## Can You Switch Fund Managers?

Yes! NPS allows you to switch once per financial year.

### How to Switch

1. Log in to CRA website (cra-nsdl.com or cra-kfintech.com)
2. Go to "Transaction" → "Change Fund Manager/Scheme Preference"
3. Select new fund manager
4. Submit request

### When to Consider Switching

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Consistently bottom performer (3+ years) | Consider switch |
| One bad year | Wait and watch |
| Major management change | Evaluate new team |
| Your risk appetite changed | Adjust allocation, maybe manager |

### When NOT to Switch

| Scenario | Why Not |
|----------|---------|
| Last year's #1 is different | Don't chase recent performance |
| Small return difference (< 1%) | Transaction cost and effort not worth it |
| You just opened account | Give it 2-3 years |

## Active vs Auto Choice: A Related Decision

When selecting fund manager, also decide on:

| Choice | What It Means | Best For |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Active Choice | You pick allocation (E, C, G, A) | Involved investors |
| Auto Choice | Lifecycle auto-rebalancing | Hands-off investors |

### Auto Choice Options

| Lifecycle Fund | Starting Equity | At Age 55 |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| LC75 (Aggressive) | 75% | 15% |
| LC50 (Moderate) | 50% | 10% |
| LC25 (Conservative) | 25% | 5% |

**Recommendation:** If you understand markets, choose Active with max equity (75% until 50). Otherwise, Auto LC75.

## Fund Manager + Allocation: The Winning Combo

| Age | Fund Manager | Allocation | Rationale |
|-----|--------------|------------|-----------|
| 25-35 | HDFC/ICICI Pru | 75% E, 15% C, 10% G | Growth phase, need alpha |
| 35-45 | SBI/HDFC | 65% E, 20% C, 15% G | Still growth, some stability |
| 45-55 | SBI/UTI | 50% E, 30% C, 20% G | Capital preservation starts |
| 55-60 | SBI/LIC | 30% E, 40% C, 30% G | Safety first |

## The Bottom Line

| Decision | My Recommendation |
|----------|-------------------|
| If you're young (< 40) | HDFC or ICICI Pru (higher equity returns) |
| If you're older (> 50) | SBI or LIC (stability, large AUM) |
| If you're unsure | SBI (largest, consistent, trustworthy) |
| If you want simplicity | Any + Auto Choice LC75 |

Fund manager matters most for equity allocation. Choose one with:
1. Strong long-term track record (10+ years)
2. Large AUM (trust indicator)
3. Consistency (not just recent outperformance)

Don't overthink it—even the "worst" NPS fund manager beats most traditional pension products.
