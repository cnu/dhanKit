No pension from employer? Don't worry. You can create your own monthly pension using Systematic Withdrawal Plan (SWP) from mutual funds.

SWP lets you withdraw a fixed amount monthly from your investments, giving you regular income while your remaining corpus continues growing.

## What is SWP?

A Systematic Withdrawal Plan automatically redeems a fixed amount from your mutual fund at regular intervals (usually monthly).

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Frequency | Monthly, quarterly, or as needed |
| Amount | Fixed sum you choose |
| Source | Your mutual fund investment |
| Taxation | Only gains portion taxed |

**Calculate your SWP:** Use our [SWP Calculator](/swp-calculator) to plan your monthly income.

## How SWP Creates Pension

### The Mechanism

| Component | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Your corpus | ₹50 lakh in mutual fund |
| Monthly withdrawal | ₹25,000 via SWP |
| What happens | Fund redeems units worth ₹25,000 |
| Remaining corpus | Continues earning returns |

### The Math

**₹50 L corpus, ₹25,000/month SWP, 10% fund return**

| Year | Withdrawal | Corpus (Start) | Growth | Corpus (End) |
|------|------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| 1 | ₹3 L | ₹50 L | +₹4.85 L | ₹51.85 L |
| 5 | ₹3 L | ₹58.2 L | +₹5.65 L | ₹60.85 L |
| 10 | ₹3 L | ₹72.5 L | +₹7.05 L | ₹76.55 L |

**Key insight:** If returns > withdrawal rate, corpus grows despite withdrawals.

## Step-by-Step: Setting Up Your Pension

### Step 1: Calculate Required Corpus

| Monthly Need | Annual Need | Corpus at 4% SWP | Corpus at 5% SWP |
|--------------|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| ₹25,000 | ₹3 L | ₹75 L | ₹60 L |
| ₹50,000 | ₹6 L | ₹1.5 Cr | ₹1.2 Cr |
| ₹75,000 | ₹9 L | ₹2.25 Cr | ₹1.8 Cr |
| ₹1,00,000 | ₹12 L | ₹3 Cr | ₹2.4 Cr |

**Formula:** Required Corpus = Annual Withdrawal ÷ SWP Rate

### Step 2: Choose the Right Funds

| Fund Type | Risk | Expected Return | Best For |
|-----------|------|-----------------|----------|
| Equity (aggressive) | High | 12%+ | Long duration, growth |
| Balanced/Hybrid | Moderate | 9-11% | Most retirees |
| Debt/Conservative | Low | 6-8% | Capital preservation |

**Recommendation for retirees:** Start with balanced advantage or conservative hybrid funds.

### Step 3: Decide Withdrawal Rate

| Rate | Safety | Corpus Duration | Best For |
|------|--------|-----------------|----------|
| 3% | Very safe | 30+ years | Early retirement |
| 4% | Safe | 25-30 years | Standard retirement |
| 5% | Moderate | 20-25 years | Later retirement |
| 6%+ | Aggressive | 15-20 years | Short horizon |

### Step 4: Set Up SWP

| Platform | Process |
|----------|---------|
| AMC website | Login → Select fund → SWP → Enter details |
| MF utility (MFU) | Login → Transact → SWP → Configure |
| Broker/Distributor | Request form or online setup |

**Details needed:**
- Withdrawal amount
- Frequency (monthly recommended)
- Date (usually 1st-10th)
- Bank account for credit

## Fund Selection for SWP

### Best Fund Types for Retirement SWP

| Fund Category | Why It Works |
|---------------|--------------|
| Balanced Advantage | Auto-rebalances, moderate risk |
| Equity Savings | Lower equity, stable |
| Aggressive Hybrid | Good growth + stability |
| Multi-asset | Diversified across asset classes |

### Sample Allocation (₹1 Cr Corpus)

| Fund Type | Allocation | Amount | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|--------|---------|
| Balanced Advantage | 50% | ₹50 L | Core income |
| Short-term Debt | 30% | ₹30 L | Stability buffer |
| Flexi-cap Equity | 20% | ₹20 L | Growth |

**SWP from:** Balanced Advantage Fund (primary source).

## Tax Efficiency of SWP

### How SWP is Taxed

Each SWP redemption has two components:
1. **Principal (cost):** Not taxed
2. **Gains:** Taxed based on holding period and fund type

| Fund Type | Short-term (< 1 year) | Long-term (> 1 year) |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Equity/Hybrid (65%+ equity) | 20% | 12.5% above ₹1.25 L/year |
| Debt/Conservative | Slab rate | Slab rate |

### Why SWP is More Tax-Efficient Than FD

**₹6 L annual income need, 30% tax bracket:**

| Source | Gross Needed | Tax | In Hand |
|--------|--------------|-----|---------|
| FD Interest | ₹8.57 L | ₹2.57 L | ₹6 L |
| SWP (equity fund) | ₹6.3 L | ₹0.3 L* | ₹6 L |

*Only gains portion taxed, and at 12.5% LTCG (after ₹1.25 L annual exemption).

**SWP can save significant taxes** depending on your gains ratio and tax bracket.

### Tax Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| FIFO redemption | First-in-first-out means older (long-term) units sold first |
| Multi-fund SWP | Spread across funds to stay under ₹1.25 L LTCG exemption |
| Equity fund preference | 12.5% LTCG vs 30% slab rate on debt |

## SWP vs Traditional Pension Options

### Comparison

| Factor | SWP | Annuity | PPF/FD |
|--------|-----|---------|--------|
| Returns | 8-12% | 5-7% | 6-7% |
| Flexibility | High | None | Moderate |
| Tax efficiency | Good | Poor | Moderate |
| Liquidity | Full | Zero | Limited |
| Inflation hedge | Yes (if equity) | No | No |
| Risk | Market risk | Insurance co. risk | Low |

### Monthly Income Comparison (₹1 Cr Corpus)

| Source | Monthly Income | Inflation-Adjusted (10 years) |
|--------|----------------|------------------------------|
| Bank FD (6.5%) | ₹54,167 | ₹54,167 (fixed, eroding) |
| Annuity (6%) | ₹50,000 | ₹50,000 (fixed, eroding) |
| SWP (4% from balanced fund) | ₹33,333 | ₹50,000+ (may increase if markets perform well) |
| SWP (5% from equity fund) | ₹41,667 | ₹60,000+ (may increase if markets perform well) |

**Key insight:** SWP starts lower but can increase with inflation.

## The Bucket Strategy for SWP

### Creating Reliable Income

| Bucket | Investment | Years | Purpose |
|--------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1: Immediate | Liquid/Ultra-short fund | 1-2 | Monthly SWP source |
| 2: Near-term | Short-term debt fund | 3-5 | Refills Bucket 1 |
| 3: Growth | Equity/Balanced fund | 5+ | Long-term growth |

### How It Works

**₹1 Cr corpus, ₹40,000/month need:**

| Bucket | Amount | Holds |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Bucket 1 | ₹10 L | 2 years expenses |
| Bucket 2 | ₹25 L | 5 years expenses |
| Bucket 3 | ₹65 L | Growth for 20+ years |

**SWP setup:** ₹40,000/month from Bucket 1 (liquid fund).

**Refill annually:** Transfer from Bucket 2 to Bucket 1.

**Refill Bucket 2:** When equity markets are up 15%+, transfer from Bucket 3.

## SWP Calculation Examples

### Example 1: Conservative Retiree

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age | 60 |
| Corpus | ₹75 L |
| Monthly need | ₹30,000 |
| Risk tolerance | Low |
| Horizon | 25 years |

**Setup:**
- Fund: Conservative Hybrid (7-8% expected return)
- SWP: ₹30,000/month (4.8% withdrawal rate)
- Expected outcome: Corpus lasts 25+ years

### Example 2: Balanced Retiree

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age | 55 (early retirement) |
| Corpus | ₹2 Cr |
| Monthly need | ₹60,000 |
| Risk tolerance | Moderate |
| Horizon | 30+ years |

**Setup:**
- Fund: Balanced Advantage (9-10% expected return)
- SWP: ₹60,000/month (3.6% withdrawal rate)
- Expected outcome: Corpus grows over time

### Example 3: Growth-Oriented

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Age | 50 (very early retirement) |
| Corpus | ₹3 Cr |
| Monthly need | ₹75,000 |
| Risk tolerance | High |
| Horizon | 35+ years |

**Setup:**
- Fund: Flexi-cap + Balanced (11-12% expected return)
- SWP: ₹75,000/month (3% withdrawal rate)
- Expected outcome: Significant corpus growth, can increase SWP

## Adjusting SWP for Inflation

### Annual Increase Method

| Year | SWP Amount | Inflation Adjustment |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| 1 | ₹40,000 | Base |
| 2 | ₹42,400 | +6% |
| 5 | ₹50,500 | +6% compounded |
| 10 | ₹67,600 | +6% compounded |

Increase SWP by 5-6% annually to maintain purchasing power.

### Sustainability Check

| Withdrawal Rate | Can Support Inflation Increase? |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| 3% | Yes, comfortably |
| 4% | Yes, if returns are 10%+ |
| 5% | Marginally |
| 6%+ | Unlikely long-term |

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Starting with Too High a Rate

| Starting Rate | Risk |
|---------------|------|
| 3-4% | Safe |
| 5-6% | Risky for 25+ year horizon |
| 7%+ | Likely corpus depletion |

**Solution:** Start conservative, increase if corpus grows.

### 2. Using Only Equity Funds

| Scenario | Risk |
|----------|------|
| Market crashes 40% | Your corpus is ₹60 L instead of ₹1 Cr |
| You continue ₹40K SWP | Now 8% withdrawal rate |

**Solution:** Use balanced or hybrid funds; maintain cash buffer.

### 3. Not Reviewing Annually

| Check | Why |
|-------|-----|
| Corpus value | Is it growing or shrinking? |
| Withdrawal rate | Has it crept up? |
| Fund performance | Is it meeting expectations? |

### 4. Single Fund Dependency

| Risk | Solution |
|------|----------|
| Fund underperforms | Diversify across 2-3 funds |
| AMC issues | Use different fund houses |
